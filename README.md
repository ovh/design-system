### Getting Started

Please read `getting-started` guide into `packages/contributing/contributing-getting-started`
to start using `ODS.

# Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with version ">= 14.15 && < 16"
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) with version ">= 2"

# Installation
Clone and install `ods` by using yarn.
```
git clone https://github.com/ovh/design-system.git
cd design-system
yarn
```

# Develop
After preparing this repository, you can launch the Storybook UI containing all built components with:
```
yarn build:prod && yarn doc && yarn start
```
Then choose the right component in the list if you want to edit it (if not, just choose whatever you want)
## Hot reload
Once you have `yarn start`-ed the project, you can edit the component with an automatic browser refresh as a result.

## Contribute
You've developed a new cool feature ? Fixed an annoying bug ? We'd be happy to hear from you !

Have a look in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ovh/design-system/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) ðŸ˜ƒ

## Migration
Please read [MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/ovh/design-system/blob/master/MIGRATION.md) to help you to manage the migration guides between each version of ODS.

## Run the tests
Tests are individually created for each UI component, but every test can be launch globally.

### Scripts
We created multiple test suites to test the different aspects of each UI component :
* All testing : `yarn test`
* Unit testing : `yarn test:spec`
* E2E testing : `yarn test:e2e`
* Screenshot testing : `yarn test:e2e:screenshot`

All testing scripts are also available with a `ci` alternative (i.e, `yarn test:ci:screenshot`.

### Global testing
They are shortcuts that will test all components in the root directory. You can launch them with the previous described scripts.

### Single component testing
You can also test a single component.

For instance, for the Button Stencil component, you can browse to it and launch what command you want:
```
cd packages/stencil/components/button
yarn test:e2e:screenshot
```
