# Overlay System

The overlay system of `ODS CDK` is based on a web component we call `surface`.
A `surface` is used to display content in the foreground, such as menu, select or tooltip, etc.:
this is the overlay concept. It is very common to all User Interface components.
This is why the overlay system is implemented in `ODS CDK`: it helps developers to make overlays simpler!

The `surface` will be displayed after a user action or programmatically.

## Principles

In order to make it works, it needs to be anchored to an element: this is the `trigger` and it represents an anchor for
the `surface`.

Depending on how you configure the `surface`, it will be displayed at some computed coordinates `(x,y)` relatively to
this `anchor`.

The overlay (the `surface`) position is computed by placing two references at the same coordinates:

- an `anchor corner` reference (that corresponds to the trigger)
- a `surface corner` reference (that corresponds to the content of the overlay)

A `corner` can be placed to the different corner of an HTML
element: `top left`, `top right`, `bottom left`, `bottom right`.

As the overlay system is compatible with the `Right To Left` HTML directionality,
we can define the `corner` references also with: `top start`, `top end`, `bottom start`, `bottom end`.
The `start` or `end` notions will be replaced by the correct `left` or `right` depending on the directionality you defined
in your app.

At the end, the `surface` is linked to his `anchor` via their `corner` references.

All the positions are computed thanks to `position strategies`.
By default, `ODS CDK` has a built-in `strategy` called `symmetry` but you can define your own strategy.

The system works with two different margins:

- a comfort margin: for instance, in comfort mode, the `surface` positioning avoids the edges of the viewport
- a limit margin: for instance, in limit mode, we allow the `surface` to overlap the comfort margin up to the margin limit

the meaning and behavior of the margins are defined inside the `strategy`.

By default, the system will use these references:

- `trigger` at `bottom-start` corner
- `surface` at `top-start` corner

When the system will compute the position of the `surface`,
it will use one of the four corner of the `anchor` as the `zero` reference
in order to display at a certain coordinate, relatively to the surface.

You have all the control over the width of the `surface` in your component:

## Directionality

The system is compatible with the `RTL directionality`.
It detects automatically the direction.
You can find here some examples:
![Direction](cdk-images/cdk-overlay-surface-direction.png)

An `RTL` conversion table is used to translate the wanted position into the real positioning.
Each position corresponds to a specific bit and allows us to change easily the result,
depending on whether we are in `RTL` mode or not.

For instance, if you indicate `Top start` for the `surface corner` and you are in `LTR` mode,
the system will translate it to `Top left`:

## Position table

The overlay management works with a position table.
Each combination of `anchor` corner reference and `surface` corner reference can be described via a position table.

The position `strategy` uses and completes this table.

The embedded default strategy is called `symmetry` and works with this base position table:

## Position computing

The overlay system starts with a position that you want to use or a default one.
The default positions are:
- `Bottom start` for the `trigger`
- `Top start` for the `surface`

### 1. RTL conversion

The first step is to normalize the wanted position thanks to the `RTL conversion` table.
Once the `start` or `end` are converted into the correct direction `left` or `right`,
it will call the `inspectors`.

### 2. Standard inspections

The `inspectors` are here to get the available space around the trigger, in the page.
Starting here, this is the `position strategy` which will define the `inspectors`
and returns the available computed spaces.

### 3. Compute position

Once the `inspections` are done, the overlay system calls the `compute` function of the position strategy.
The system will check the returned result:

- returns `undefined`: it keep the position
- returns a `fallback`: it will apply the fallback position
- returns a different position (switching): it will attempt a second time the workflow with the new position

### 4. Fallback inspections

When the returned result of `compute` is a fallback, it will determine another available spacing
through the fallback `inspectors`.
The result are computed by the `position strategy`.

### 5. Standard appliers

When there is no fallback position to apply, the system will call the standard appliers in order to
get the final `verticalOffset`, `verticalALignment`, `HorizontalOffset`, `HorizontalAlignment` and `maxHeight`.
This is the nominal case when the overlay can be entirely displayed into the page.

### 6. Fallback appliers

When we are in a fallback positioning, we had determinate that there is not enought space for displaying.
It will call different appliers for `verticalOffset`, `verticalALignment`, `HorizontalOffset`,
`HorizontalAlignment` and `maxHeight`.
Accordingly with the `position strategy`, the position will be different and in a degraded mode.

### 7. Apply position

At the end, the final position will be applied on the `surface` container.
