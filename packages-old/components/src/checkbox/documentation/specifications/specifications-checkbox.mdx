## Description

The `checkbox` component is a smart component that have only logical behavior, no UI at all.
The given child as main content plays the role of the UI part only.
This component is compatible with `tile` or some custom components.

`checkbox` brings all the behavior of a vanilla checkbox.
It renders a hidden vanilla `input` with all the properties that applies on it.
It has `name` and `value` attributes,
it can be `checked` and `disabled`.

`checkbox` override the defined focusable behavior of its child by disabling `tabindex` on it.
So, it manages focusing by `click` or `tabulation`.

When `checkbox` has been focused through the mouse, it adds `has-focus` attribute on itself and on its child.
When it has been focused by the `tabulation`, it adds `has-focus` attribute on itself too, but have a `:focus-visible`
enabled that add a `dashed` border to itself.

Setting `disabled` property on Checkbox component triggers `disabled` property on its child.
It is the same for `checked` and `has-focus`.

### usage with custom component

it can be used with your own component from another libraries.
The only constraints is that component must manage these attributes:

- `checked`
- `disabled`
- `has-focus` in order to display it with the `focused` styles

and optionally with these:

- `updating` in order to manage a loading style during `checking` (used for pessimistic update)

```html
<!-- stencil example -->
<osds-checkbox value="my-value" name="my-input-name">
  <your-custom-component>checkbox UI like</your-custom-component>
</osds-checkbox>
```
