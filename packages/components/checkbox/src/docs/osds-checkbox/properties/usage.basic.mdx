The nominal way to use it is with another component that will manage all the visual aspect only.

*with `tile` component*

<osds-checkbox value="my-value" name="my-input-name">
  <osds-tile interactive>Radio with Tile in it</osds-tile>
</osds-checkbox>

```html

<osds-checkbox value="my-value" name="my-input-name">
  <osds-tile interactive>Radio with Tile in it</osds-tile>
</osds-checkbox>
```

> here we use the `tile` in an interactive way in order to have the styles of interactions (focus, hover, active, etc)
