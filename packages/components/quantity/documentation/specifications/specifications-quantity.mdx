## Description
The Quantity aims to show and modify a desired quantity.
It can be displayed as 2 [Button](/)s with an [Input](/). Standard use for Quantity is with 2 osds-button as controls and an osds-input of type=number
but native input can also be used as input and `<div>` or another component can be used as controls.

##### Listeners
* Listening input. If an osds-input is used, it listens odsValueChange event. If an HTMLInputElement is used, it listens onChange event.<br/>
  When input value changes, input's `[min]` | `[max]` property is checked and minus | plus control is set to `[disabled]` if `[min]` | `[max]` value has been reached.
* Listening native event (click event).<br/> Trigger stepDown() public method of input.
* Listening native event (click event).<br/> Trigger stepUp() public method of input.

The user is warned if an input (osds-input or native input) cannot be found. Same goes for minus and plus controls.

## Properties
Setting `disabled` property on Quantity component triggers `disabled` property on its 3 children.
Only Quantity component knows its 3 children, none of them (controls, input) know parent component.

#### Types
Types don't apply directly to Quantity. It comes from used components (ie.Input and Button components).
