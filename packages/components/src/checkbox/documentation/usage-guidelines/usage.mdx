## Usage
The `checkbox` component is a meta component that has only logical behavior, no UI at all.
The given child as main content plays the role of the UI part.
This component is compatible with `tile` or some custom components.

`checkbox` brings all the behavior of a vanilla checkbox.
It renders a hidden vanilla `input` with all the properties that applies on it.
