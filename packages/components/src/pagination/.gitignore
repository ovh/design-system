# Local Stencil command generates external ods component build at the root of the project
# Excluding them is a temporary solution to avoid pushing generated files
# But the issue may cause main build (ods-component package) to fails, as it detects multiples occurences
# of the same component and thus you have to delete all those generated dir manually
