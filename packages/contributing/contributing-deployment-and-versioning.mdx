# Deployment and versioning

**NB:** releases process is handled by ODS core team but you can still have a look here about our process.

## Deployment

The release schema looks like this:

![ODS deployment schema](contributing-images/ods-deployment.png "ODS deployment schema")

release/next acts as our main branch, then for major and minor versioning a new release/* branch is created.

For patch versioning, it can be added in the specific release/* or release/next, depending on its scope.

## Releases

In order to make a new release of the `ODS` packages, you must:

- be sure that you are on a release branch like `release/next` or `release/X.Y`
- no local changes to commit
- your local branch is up-to-date

Then, to make a release, you have to execute the npm script `yarn ods:<VERSION_TYPE>`
where `<VERSION_TYPE>` can be `patch`, `minor`, `major`, `premajor` `prerelase` or `graduate`.

### Versioning commands: what level of tag to use?

Here's a summed up table of which command to launch to create the appropriate tag:

| Command               | Target       | Usage                                | version before   | version after   |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| `yarn ods:prepatch`   | `testing`    | Prepare patch release                | `1.0.0`          | `1.0.1-alpha.0` |
| `yarn ods:preminor`   | `testing`    | Prepare minor release                | `1.0.0`          | `1.1.0-alpha.0` |
| `yarn ods:premajor`   | `testing`    | Prepare major release                | `1.0.0`          | `2.0.0-alpha.0` |
| `yarn ods:prerelease` | `testing`    | Prepare a new pre-release            | `1.2.3-alpha.2`  | `1.2.3-alpha.3` |
| `yarn ods:patch`      | `production` | Fix a bug                            | `1.0.0`          | `1.0.1`         |
| `yarn ods:minor`      | `production` | Add features without breaking change | `1.0.0`          | `1.1.0`         |
| `yarn ods:major`      | `production` | Add breaking change                  | `1.0.0`          | `2.0.0`         |
| `yarn ods:graduate`   | `production` | From `-alpha` versions to plain tag  | `3.1.2-alpha.21` | `3.1.2`         |

You can find all explanations for these commands below:

### Patch: fix a bug

You fixed a bug **(without any other breaking changes)** for a released version in the branch `release/X.Y`.
You have to release it from the same branch:

```bash
yarn ods:patch
```

### Minor: add extra features

You added one or several features **without any breaking changes** in the branch `release/next`.
You have to release it from the `release/next` branch:

```bash
yarn ods:minor
```

Then, create a release branch from the commit tag that correspond to the version like `release/X.Y`.
It will be used for bug fixes later (patch).
Once the support for the version has ended, the branch will be un-referenced.

### Major: breaking changes

You added breaking changes in the `release/next` branch.
You have to generate a major version from `release/next` branch.

```bash
yarn ods:major
```

Then, create a release branch from the commit tag that corresponds to the version like `release/X.Y`.
It will be used for bugfixes later (patch).
Once the support for the version has ended, the branch will be unreferenced.

### PRE-patch: prepare a future patch release

You fixed a bug in the `release/next` branch, and you want to release it as a candidate for testing purpose only **(not
production)**.

You can generate a PRE-patch version from `release/next` branch:

```bash
yarn ods:prepatch
```

Once this version is finalized, you will have to graduate the release: see graduate release below.

### PRE-minor: prepare a future release without breaking changes

You added features in the `release/next` branch, and you want to release it as a candidate for testing purpose only **(
not production)**.

You can generate a PRE-minor version from `release/next` branch:

```bash
yarn ods:preminor
```

Once this version is finalized, you will have to graduate the release: see Graduate a release below.

### PRE-major: prepare a future release with breaking changes

You added features in the `release/next` branch, and you want to release it as a candidate for testing purpose only **(
not production)**.

You can generate a PRE-major version from `release/next` branch:

```bash
yarn ods:premajor
```

Then create a release branch from the commit tag that correspond to the version like `release/X.Y-alpha`.
It will be used later in case of modification (fix, features, breaking changes).
Once this version is finalized, you will have to graduate the release: see Graduate a release below.

### PRE-release: prepare a new pre-release

You already are in a prerelease version with `alpha.x` (meaning you previously made a `pre-major`, `pre-minor`
or `pre-patch`).

You want to prerelease a new one and increment the `alpha` number. You want to continue prerelease for testing purpose
only **(not production)**.

You have to generate a new PRE-release version from `release/X.Y-alpha` branch:

```bash
yarn ods:prerelease
```

Once this version is finalized, you will have to graduate the release: see Graduate a release below.

### Graduate a release

You already released a `pre-major/minor/patch` or a `pre-release`.

All tests are valid, you want to release the final version like from `1.2.0-alpha-X` to `1.2.0`.

You have to graduate the version from `release/X.Y-alpha` branch:

```bash
yarn ods:graduate
```

Then, create a release branch from the commit tag that correspond to the version like `release/X.Y`.
It will be used for bug fixes later (patch).
Once the support for the version has ended, the branch will be un-referenced.
