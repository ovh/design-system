# Testing

Each component must be tested in several ways to ensure consistency throughout ODS source code.
Tests will guarantee that the project still work the same as before and that new contributions are not introducing
issues.

## Introduction

### Location

Tests of `stencil` components are located under `packages/stencil/components/my-component/src/components` besides each
file to test:

- `*.spec.ts`: unit tests of the corresponding file
- `*.e2e.ts`: functional end-to-end tests of the corresponding file
- `*.e2e.screenshot.ts`: end-to-end screenshot tests of the corresponding file

### Running tests from the command line

When you are in the component folder (for instance, `packages/stencil/components/button`), run:

#### Unit tests

> yarn test:spec:ci

#### End-to-end tests

> yarn test:e2e:ci

#### Screenshot tests

> yarn test:e2e:ci:screenshot

To update screenshot references you can run:
> yarn test:e2e:ci:screenshot:update

## Unit

For unit testing, the component is tested in the following cases:

* it should render as expected (at DOM scope only - checking the component itself and its Shadow DOM)
* every component attribute should:
  * have a default value (if attribute is required)
  * behave correctly with every defined values (initialization, DOM reflection, binding, modification -if any-,
    mutability -if any-)
* check if content slots exist correctly in the Shadow DOM (if any)
* check public method (if any)
* check event (if any)

Currently, we are using Jest library for testing, with its nomenclature:

```
describe('spec:component', () => {
    it('should render', async () => {
      await setup();
      expect(page.root.shadowRoot).toBeTruthy();
      expect(page.rootInstance).toBeTruthy();
    });
})
```

## End-to-end (E2E)

For end-to-end testing, the component is tested in the following cases:

* it should render as expected (at UI rendering scope only - checking the component render in the DOM)
* check public method (if any)
* check event (if any)

Currently, we are using Jest library for testing, with its nomenclature, and Puppeteer for E2E rendering.

```
describe('e2e:component', () => {
  el = await page.find('osds-%component%');
    it('should render', async () => {
      await setup();
      expect(el).not.toBeNull();
      expect(el).toHaveClass('hydrated');
    });
})
```

## Visual regression

For visual regression testing, the component is tested in two ways:

* a full display page, containing the component with all its possible combinations of attributes, content slots or
  particular examples
* a unitary visual testing, with its most relevant usages, as well as some behavior testing (hovering, focusing or
  triggering -clicking, keyboard event- the component)

The result is based on the pixel ratio difference; if the ratio difference is large enough to trigger an error, the
visual diff between reference and current component screenshots needs to be reviewed manually.

Currently, we are using Jest library for testing, with its nomenclature, and Puppeteer for E2E rendering and
screenshots.

## Code coverage

All components are tested for code coverage, the expectations are to be at least above 90% of code coverage.

## Accessibility check

Every component has to be as accessible as possible, meaning:

* it is readable on UI or with a screen reader
* it can be zoomed in for readability
* it should be focusable if relevant
* for interactive components, the ability of accessing them through mouse and keyboard events
