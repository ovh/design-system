## Introduction

All components use the theming system.

Defining a theme means define some configuration as following:
* **colorConfig**: all the defined color palettes with hsl CSS colors
* **sizeConfig**: all the defined size properties for each component
* **typographyConfig**: all the defined typography properties for each component

You can read more documentation on the [Theming Principles](?path=/story/code-our-principles-theming--page)

## Customize a style from theming

You can customize a color, a size or even a typography for all components.

> ⚠️️ **Please note**<br />
> Be sure to customize a style when it is strictly necessary for your case.

### On the component itself
You will need to apply your specific style on the host of the component itself.
For instance, you would like to apply a specific color to your component, different from the one offered by the theme:
``` css
:host {
  background-color: red;
}
```

### Override imported component style
You are using an ODS component, with its own style, in your component but, you need to customize some of its style.
You will need to use the correct selector in your CSS.

For instance, if you would like to customize the OdsIcon style, with a specific color, in your component, you just need to use the following selector:
``` css
osds-icon {
  background-color: red;
}
```

Regarding the OdsButton, we assigned a `.button` class to it so you won't be able to override its style as above example.
You can customize it as following:
``` css
osds-button::part(button) {
  background-color: red;
}
```

`::part` will allow you to select and style elements inside a shadow tree.

### Customize theme color
You can customize the theme color for your component or an imported component using `ods-get-color-variable()` as following:
``` css
:host {
    color: ods-get-color-variable($intent-name: primary, $hue: '800');
    background-color: ods-get-color-variable($palette-name: 'blue', $hue: '050');
  }
```

Difference between intent-name and palette-name is described in [Theming Principles](?path=/story/code-our-principles-theming--page).
