## Description

The breadcrumb component has several items.
Each item (breadcrumb-item) reuses the link component which will always have the primary color. The properties of the link are used for redirection.
The last item is set so that it cannot be clicked on via the text component (osds-text).

## Colors

Only one color is applied on the breadcrumb-item with the osds-link: Primary.
The primary color from your theme is applied.

## Sizes

The Code has the same size that the osds link and osds text.

## Behaviours

The breadcrumb items are all displayed if there are 4 or less of them.
Only the first and the last are displayed if there are more than 4.
