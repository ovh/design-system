## Description

Pagination helps to separate an important quantity of data into multiple pages, having links to the relative pages.

## Anatomy

Five areas are included in the component :

- Previous page arrow Button (presented as disabled)
- First page number Button
- Selected page Button
- (in situations) Truncated pagination (ellipsis Button)
- Next page arrow Button

## Colors

Only one color is applied on the Pagination: Primary.
The primary color from your theme is applied.

## Sizes

The Pagination exists in a unique size SM.

## Behaviours

A Pagination can be focused, hovered and disabled.
Current page Button has a selected styling, yet it is a not clickable Button (as readonly). Ellispsis Buttons are also not clickable.
If the selected page number is the first page, the previous page arrow Button is disabled; same thing applies with the last page as selected and the next page arrow Button disabled.

## Accessibility

All Buttons are accessible via tabulation controls.
You can select the page by pressing space or enter.
