## Description
A Popover will provide additional information to the user in a clear and concise way.
It is commonly used to appear by click so crucial information should not be displayed in the Popover.

## Zoning

A Popover has potentially five areas:

- A container: It contains the main content of the Popover
- A header: a title to introduce the content below
- A Main content: it displays the Popover text. Links can be added too in this section.
- (optional) A footer: Interactive elements such as buttons or links can be added in this section.
- (not available for the moment) A tip: it shows the relationship between the Popover and where it has been triggered from

## Behavior

By default, a Popover is hidden to the user.
It triggers when the user clicks on the Popover's trigger element such as an icon, a text or a button.
The Popover can be closed or dismissed by clicking anywhere on the page outside of the Popover's container.

## Placement

Popover has automatic positioning feature. It can detect the edge of the browser so the container always stays visible on a page.
