# Components principles
_All components have to follow some rules about color,
size, variant and contrast_

## Color
Each component take as input the color.
If no color is specified, the default one is applied.

the color can be:
| color         | example                                                        | description                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **default**   | <img alt="Preview of default" src={props.links.default} />     | The default color, regardless of brand colors |
| **primary**   | <img alt="Preview of primary" src={props.links.primary} />     | Referring to the brand color                  |
| **text**      | <img alt="Preview of text" src={props.links.text} />           | Referring to the brand text color             |
| **accent**    | <img alt="Preview of accent" src={props.links.accent} />       | Referring to the accent brand color           |
| **error**     | <img alt="Preview of error" src={props.links.error} />         | Referring to the error color                  |
| **warning**   | <img alt="Preview of warning" src={props.links.warning} />     | Referring to the warning color                |
| **success**   | <img alt="Preview of success" src={props.links.success} />     | Referring to the success color                |
| **info**      | <img alt="Preview of info" src={props.links.info} />           | Referring to the info color                   |
| **promotion** | <img alt="Preview of promotion" src={props.links.promotion} /> | Referring to the promotion color              |


## Size
Each component can have different sizes.
If no size is specified, the `m` (middle) size is applied.

- xs
- sm
- md `by default`
- lg
- xl

The `size` attribute is an `enum` and set by default to `m`

## Variant
Each component can have some variant.
They are specific for each component.
A variant is an alternative design for the same component.

For instance, the `button` component have some variants:

The `variant` attribute is an `enum` and set by default to the default variant.

## Contrasted
A component can be displayed in a `contrasted` way.
When a component is placed on top of another with the same `color` for both,
the second has to be contrasted.

For instance, if we have a cart with a `primary` color (applied on background)
and we have to place a button inside it.
If the button have to be displayed in `primary` color too,
we can have a contrast problem : same color on cart's background
and in button's background.
To avoid this, the contrast notion allow us to display a component
in a contrasted way.
So, here the button has to be contrasted.

The `contrasted` attribute is a `boolean` and set by default to `false`

## Disabled
Each component can be deactivated, and the user cannot interact with it.

The `disabled` attribute is a `boolean` and set by default to `false`
