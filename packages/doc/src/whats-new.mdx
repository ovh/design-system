## v12.0.0

First release on GitHub. There is no new feature in this version. It is now open source

## v11.0.0

Flag component has been modified; you’ll need to update as explained in the migration guide.
For more details about assets, see [Installation](/docs/code-stencil-components-how-to-install--page#assets) page.
New attributes are available on this component: `lazy`, `assetPath` and `src`.

Before importing any component you now have to setup ods, for more details see [migration guide 10.x to 11.x](/story/code-migration-guide-10-x-to-11-x--page).

[Dual range](/story/ui-components-range-atom-web-component--dual) is now available for Range component; It offers two handles to set a min and max value.

To build resilient infrastructure and promote sustainable industrialization, we moved code that could be agnostic.
Now, ODS components logic has been moved into controllers.
If you want to contribute to ODS by developing new components, please refer to the how-to section for controllers in our [Storybook](?path=/story/contributing-how-to-s-create-a-controller--page).

Now, Button component has `download` and `rel` new attributes available when it is used as a link (href).

We had blur events on Quantity component to set the correct value regarding the Quantity bounds.
It means when the user set manually a value that is out of bounds for Quantity, the value will be automatically reset to a correct value.
When Quantity is out of bounds, the field value is now in error state.

As it is a major version, you have to do the [migration guide 10.x to 11.x](/story/code-migration-guide-10-x-to-11-x--page)

## v10.2.0

A new library called `CDK` for `Component Development Kit` is available.
The main objective is to make the development to be easier thanks to helpers.
The first integrated feature is an overlay system that allows manipulating and displaying content
on foreground of the page.
[CDK Documentation](/story/cdk-getting-started--page)

We added a new entire section for `contributions` in the storybook.
Feel free to read the [Contributing Documentation](/story/contributing-getting-started--page) if you want to contribute.

We simplified our developer environment with a `global.dev.ts` file in order to
make the developer tests isolated from the production build.

We optimized our CI/CD workflow for a more reactive and efficient build time and release time.

We fixed some issue about automated screenshot testing with some timeout.

[Technical Changelog](/story/code-changelog--page)

## v10.1.0

We added the select component (version 1).
[See Select Documentation](/story/ui-components-select-atom-overview--page)

[Technical Changelog](/story/code-changelog--page)

## v10.0.0

We updated a lot of third dependencies (stencilJs, typescript, jest, puppeteer, ...):
```text
@stencil/core ~2.6.0 to ~2.18.1
@stencil/sass ~1.4.1 to ~2.0.0
jest ~26.6.3 to ~27.4.5
@types/jest ~26.0.24 to ~27.5.2

```
> If you are an `ODS` contributor, you may need to do some changes

We now build all of our components for `React` and `Vue` frameworks.
They allow to use all the potential and features of your high-end JS framework.
You can read the updated [Getting Started](/story/code-getting-started--page)
and more especially the [ODS Starters chapter](/story/code-getting-started--page#ods-starters)
to initialize an App with ODS and see how it works depending the framework.

Also, `ods-cart` is no more impacted by a parent container with `text-align:center`.

`ods-textarea` had an incorrect `spellcheck` property than could be equal to `spellcheck="false'` which is incorrect in HTML.
Now it is in DOM only if it is `true`.

You can now disable animation on `ods-toggle` by defining a CSS value `--ods-toggle-transition-slider: none`.

Css variables `--ods-size-squish-n-*` and `--ods-size-stretch-n-*` are no more incorrect.
It was previously set with only one number instead of two, accordingly with CSS3.

As it is a major version, you have to do the [migration guide 9.x to 10.x](/story/code-migration-guide-9-x-to-10-x--page)

[Technical Changelog](/story/code-changelog--page)
