# Symmetry strategy

This `position strategy` is the default built-in strategy used inside the overlay system.
The main principles are:

- always positioning the `surface` around the `trigger`, without any overlap (except if not enough space)
- when there is not enough space, in a direction, we display the `surface` in the opposite direction.
  This is why it is called `symmetry`
- When there is not enough space in the opposite direction too, we must fall back the position with something different.
  In this case, we stay as much as possible at the original position but never overlapping the limit margin.
  And we could limit the `surface` size to a smaller size.

## Symmetry position table

Positions that correspond to a `vertical` and `horizontal` positioning are defined (`green tick`).
Some are not available because of the overlapping of the `surface` container on top of the `anchor` (`red cross`).

The `orange` arrows shows the position switching when there is not enough space on the vertical `Y` axis.
The `blue` arrows are here for horizontal axis.

## Symmetry position strategy

The `symmetry` strategy starts with the default position, except if the user specified another one.

### 1. RTL conversion

The process is internal to the overlay system and is applied for all strategies.

### 2. Standard inspections

The standard mode checks the space between the border of the `anchor` and the border of the `comfort` margin.

### 3. Compute position

When there is not enough space and this is the first computation,
it switches to the opposite position, as with `symmetry`, and it starts again with `standard inspections`.

When it already switched off, it will apply a fallback system.
Indeed, there is not enough space on the both sides of the `trigger`.
It will call the `fallback inspectors`.

### 4. Fallback inspections

The `fallback` mode check the space between the border of the `anchor` and the border of the `limit` margin.
Then, it will call the `fallback` appliers.

### 5. Standard appliers

When there is no fallback position to apply, the system will call the standard appliers in order to
get the final `verticalOffset`, `verticalALignment`, `HorizontalOffset`, `HorizontalAlignment` and `maxHeight`.
This is the nominal case when the overlay can be entirely displayed between the `anchor` and the `comfort` margin.

### 6. Fallback appliers

When we are in a fallback positioning, we had determinate that there is not enough space for displaying on both sides.
If the `surface` size is inferior to the space between the opposites `comfort` margin of both sides,
it starts by staying sticky to the original side of the position, but overlapping the `anchor`.

If there is not enough space between `comfort` margin, it displays the `surface` vertically
or horizontally centered between `limit` margins and it won't grow anymore.
In this case, if the viewport is very small, the content will always stay in this configuration.

In all cases, the content will be scrollable if needed.

### 7. Apply position

At the end, the final position will be applied on the `surface` container.
