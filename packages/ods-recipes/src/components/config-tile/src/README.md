# Config Tile

The Config Tile is used to select and configure a product by choosing options, quantities, or variations.

## Config Tile

The Config Tile is a selectable tile designed for product configuration. It can include various interactive elements
such as checkboxes or radio buttons, quantity selectors, and pricing information.

Use this recipe when users need to configure the details of a product, for example by choosing options, adjusting
quantities, or reviewing price impacts. The Config Tile can be displayed horizontally or vertically to adapt to
different contexts.

## Location Tile

The Location Tile displays a location (country or city) as a selectable tile. Use it in listings or configuration
flows when location details and pricing need to be clearly presented.

## Do's & Don'ts

### Do

- Use Config Tile to let users select, configure or customize a product or service.
- Use radio buttons when only one option can be selected, and checkboxes for multiple options.
- Use the horizontal layout for dense configuration steps or side-by-side options.
- Use the vertical layout when more content or clarity is required.

### Don't

- Use Config Tile for simple product discovery or marketing content. Use Product Card related recipes instead.
- Overload a single tile with too many interactive controls.
- Mix selection patterns (radio button and checkbox) within the same group.
