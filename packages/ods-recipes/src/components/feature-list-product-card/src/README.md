# Feature List Product Card

The Feature List Product Card is a rich, vertical and detailed product presentation card used for comparing products or
providing in-depth information. It displays structured content in a vertical layout: category, badges, title, subtitle,
product description, a Select component for configuration, pricing details (including taxes, duration, and promotional
conditions), an action button, and a detailed feature list with check icon indicating included items. A link completes
the card for additional information.

Use this card when you need to help users evaluate a product in detail, compare features, understand pricing, or select
a product variant before taking action. It is suitable for catalog pages, comparison tools, and purchase funnels.
