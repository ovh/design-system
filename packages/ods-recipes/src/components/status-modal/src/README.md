# Status Modal

## Variants

### Information

The Default Status Modal is used to briefly interrupt the flow to inform users of important details, confirm successful
actions, or draw attention to potential issues, offering them a clear choice to proceed or cancel.

### Critical

The Critical Status Modal is used when the system must urgently warn the user about a severe issue or a potentially
risky action. It contains a prominent title, an explanation of the critical situation, and two actions: a cancel button
and a critical action button guiding the user toward resolving or confirming the critical change.

Use this modal when the user must make an explicit decision before proceeding, or when continuing without
acknowledgement could lead to negative consequences.
