## Attributes changes

`dummy` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

Has been removed.

You can use the new `better-dummy` attribute to obtain the same rendering.

## Migration examples

Dummy button:
```html
<ods-button dummy></ods-button>
<!-- is now -->
<ods-button better-dummy></ods-button>
```
