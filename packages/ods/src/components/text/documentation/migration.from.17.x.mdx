## Attributes changes

`dummy` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

Has been removed.

You can use the new `better-dummy` attribute to obtain the same rendering.

## Migration examples

Dummy text:
```html
<ods-text dummy></ods-text>
<!-- is now -->
<ods-text better-dummy></ods-text>
```
