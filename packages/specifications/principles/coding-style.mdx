# Component coding style

## General rules

To achieve consistency in OVHcloud Design System, there are some rules regarding code standards we would like you to follow.

- [Linters / formatters](#linters-and-formatters)
- [Controllers](#controllers)
- [Typescript](#typescript)
    - [any type](#any-type)
    - [TSDoc comments](#tsdoc-comments)
- [ODS component dependencies](#ods-component-dependencies)
- [SCSS](#scss)
- [Testing](#testing)
    - [Types of tests](#types-of-tests)
        - [Unit testing](#unit-testing)
        - [End-to-end testing](#end-to-end-testing)
        - [Visual regression testing](#visual-regression-testing)

### Linters and formatters

As automated process of analyzing code, we are using ESLint with `typescript-eslint` for linting.
For code formatting, we are using Prettier.

### Controllers
Logic has to be done in controllers so it can be used by the different implementations.
To summarize, all generic code has to be delocalized into our `Core` folder : `@ovhcloud/ods-core/src/components/`

### TypeScript

#### any type
You should avoid to use `any` type and consider using whether a type `intersection` or `generics`.

#### Types
For those who are using types for expressing how a component should be restricted to, it is mostly common to use the
proper way of declaring it.
As of now, we are using two declarations that are exported :
- an _Array_ constant, which contains a read-only array with all values (in case you need values for documentation)
- an _union type_ that can be used elsewhere

>**Example of declaration for a button variant (in TypeScript) :**
>```typescript
>export const ButtonColorValues = ['default', 'primary', 'secondary'] as const;
>export type ButtonColor = typeof ButtonColorValues[number];
>```
>rendering as :
>```text
>ButtonColorValues = readonly ['default', 'primary', 'secondary'];
>ButtonColor = 'default' | 'primary' | 'secondary';
>```

#### TSDoc comments
By using TSDoc, we can comment and document the detail of the code easily so, you should add TSDoc comments to the following:
* All classes
* All properties
* All methods, events and behaviors (if any)

Component automatic technical specifications will be generated when you use TSDoc and TypeDoc syntax.

### ODS component dependencies
All components can be used in other components.

In your component, you should have a `global.dev.ts` file where you need to import the ODS component you would like to use:
``` typescript
import '@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components/%component%';
```

Then, in `stencil.config.ts`, you need to exclude the imported component for React and Vue as following:
```
reactOutput: {
    componentCorePackage: '@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components/%component%',
    // exclude peer dependencies that corresponds to www usage
    excludeComponents: ['osds-%component%']
  },
  vueOutput: {
      componentCorePackage: '@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components/%component%',
      // exclude peer dependencies that corresponds to www usage
      excludeComponents: ['osds-%component%']
    },
```

### SCSS

#### styles
* In `packages/stencil/components/your-component/src/components/your-component/styles`, please add your mixins and SCSS related to color, size or typography of the component.

#### Best practices
* You should not set a margin on host element.
