# Theming
_All components uses the theming system_

Defining a theme means define some configuration :
- colorConfig: all the defined color palettes with hsla CSS colors
- sizeConfig: all the defined size properties for each component
- typographyConfig: all the defined typography properties for each component

Theming the color means using the colorConfig and use the concepts of palettes and colors.
Theming the size means using sizeConfig and manipulate some properties like height or width.
Theming the typography means using the typographyConfig and apply fonts related properties.

## Color

A color palette is made of different hue.
The hue is a number like `100` or `500` and defines the shade of the color.
There is also some contrasted hue. The purpose of this is to have a contrasted color in foreground of one hue.
For instance, a color on a color `blue-100` must be a `blue-100-contrasted`.

Here is an example of `blue` palette defined like this:

| hue            | color                   |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| 100            | hsla(193, 100%, 87%, 1) |
| 100-contrasted | hsla(218, 100%, 42%, 1) |
| 500            | hsla(218, 100%, 42%, 1) |
| 500-contrasted | hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 1)    |

So we have multiple color palette like `gray`, `blue`, `green`, etc.
Each of theses color palettes is defined in the `colorConfig` of the theme.

Defining the color theming also means defining the different usage of color palette.
It is the notion of color intent :

<OdsThemeColorIntents />

So for each color intent we have to configure the palette to use for the theme :

| color       | example            |
|-------------|--------------------|
| `default`   | use a gray palette |
| `primary`   | blue palette       |
| `accent`    | green palette      |
| `error`     | red palette        |
| `warning`   | orange palette     |
| `success`   | green palette      |
| `info`      | blue palette       |
| `promotion` | pink palette       |

At the end, the components that have an input named `color` is the color intent.
The component will use the defined palette as the main color.
Each component can also directly retrieve a specific palette intent like `error` and apply some color.


### Schema

![Theming color schema](specifications/theming/theming-color-schema.png)

**Theming system** have all the palette definitions.
It contains all the possible values of hue for each color.
At the end, the system does not have hsla colors but CSS variables like `var(--ods-color-blue-100)`.
The different components indirectly will use only these variables as value.

The **theme** contains all the real values of color for each of the palette definition.
This is the hsla colors. Each one is defined also for the contrasted one.
The theme is made of defined variables like `--ods-color-blue-100: hsla(193, 100%, 87%, 1);` for the `blue-100` itself.
There also the variables with the color intent name like `--ods-color-primary-100: var(--ods-color-blue-100);`
and corresponding to the color intents of the theme.
These variables will be used by the components trough the shadow dom.

When you import a theme, you will import here all the value of color CSS variable and the component receives them.

## Size

Defining a theming also means set some value about the `sizes` of the components.
This part of the system manage the CSS properties related to the `width`, `height`, `padding` or `margin`.

### Schema

![Theming size schema](specifications/theming/theming-size-schema.png)

**Theming system** have all the size definitions.
It contains the different values of the CSS properties.
But theses values are CSS variables like `var(--ods-size-button-md-height)`.
The different components indirectly will use only these variables as value.

The **theme** contains all the real values of size for each component.
Like the color system, the component will only use the variable that the theme is defining.

## Typography

Defining a theming also means set some value about the `typography`.
A typography is defined by different levels, like `title`, `caption`.
A specific typography level can be set for the button as it has a specific typography.
This part of the system manage the CSS properties related to the fonts like `font-size`,
`font-family`, `font-weight`.

the typography levels :

| level    | description                                                            |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| title    | the different title to use in the application just like `H1`, `H2`,... |
| subtitle | subtitles like named                                                   |
| body     | the main typography to be used in all text                             |
| caption  | typography to be used for the captions                                 |
| button   | specific typography for the buttons                                    |
| input    | specific typography for the inputs                                     |

### Schema

![Theming typography schema](specifications/theming/theming-typography-schema.png)

**Theming system** have all the typography definitions.
It contains the different values of the CSS properties.
But theses values are CSS variables like `var(--ods-typography-title-md-font-family)`.
A typography is dependant of the size of the component.
The variable is made of the component name but also the corresponding size.
The different components indirectly will use only these variables as value.

The **theme** contains all the real values of typography for each component.
Like the color system, the component will only use the variable that the theme is defining.
