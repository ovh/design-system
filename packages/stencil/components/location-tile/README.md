# getting started

this component depends on `osds-flag` and `osds-tile`.
In order to use it, you must include in your application those two dependencies too.

If you are using single package per component, so you need to import :
- `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components/tile`
- `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components/flag`
- `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components/location-tile`

If you are using the bundled components, you just need to import:
- `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components`
