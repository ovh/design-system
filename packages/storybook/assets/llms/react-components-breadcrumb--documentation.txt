_A list of  showing the current page location in the navigational hierarchy._

3.  Current

## Overview

---

**Breadcrumb** is used to define the user's position in a site hierarchy, it can also be useful for a finer navigation in an inner application.

## Usage

---

It has several usages :

-   Displaying subpages of a site structure
-   Show step progress of a process
-   Simplify site structure navigation in a quicker way

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Start the Breadcrumb trail with a link to the homepage, using a "home" Icon or the "Home" label for example |
| - Reflect the actual page hierarchy in the Breadcrumb structure (e.g., Section > Subsection > Current page) |
| - Use Breadcrumb to provide contextual orientation, especially in deep navigation paths |
| - Ensure that each Breadcrumb item (except the last one) is a clickable link to a parent page |
| - Add the ellipsis to collapse long paths (more than 4 Links visible) |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use Breadcrumbs as a primary navigation method, they are secondary and contextual only |
| - Don't include external links in Breadcrumb items, all links should be internal |
| - Don't nest Breadcrumbs or place more than one Breadcrumb component on the same page |
| - Don't exceed 4 levels of depth. Overly complex paths reduce clarity and usability |
| - Don't make the current page a link. The last item should be plain text to indicate the user's location |
| - Don't change the Breadcrumb order to reflect user history or actions, it should always match site structure |
| - Don't use Breadcrumb if the page doesn't belong to a clearly hierarchical structure |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Breadcrumb**
2.  **Page link**
3.  **Current page**
4.  **Ellipsis**

## Placement

---

A **Breadcrumb** is used at the top of a web page, preferably start-aligned.

Its width is automatic, relative to its content and is not adjustable.

## Behavior

---

When the **Breadcrumb** has more than 4 links visible, an ellipsis is displayed as a replacement for the middle link.

A click on the ellipsis will expand all previously hidden links inline, the collapsed state can't be redone afterward.

The **Breadcrumb** links are kept inline, even on mobile viewports.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

All links within the **Breadcrumb** component are focusable, following the reading order. The last item, which represents the current page, is static text and does not receive focus.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

-   Pressing Tab moves focus through each link in the **Breadcrumb** trail
-   Pressing Enter while a link is focused navigates to the corresponding page
-   When an ellipsis (...) appears due to a long **Breadcrumb** trail (more than 4 elements), it behaves as a link:
    -   Pressing Enter expands the full **Breadcrumb** list
    -   Once expanded, additional link become accessible via Tab navigation

## Accessibility

---

This component complies with the [Breadcrumb WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/) .

### Identifying the Breadcrumb with aria-label

**Breadcrumbs** are a form of navigation, but they serve a specific purpose distinct from primary navigation menus. To ensure they are correctly recognized, an [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) should be added to explicitly identify them.

**Breadcrumb Links** follow the same accessibility guidelines as a standard .

1.  
2.  
3.  
4.  Current page

```jsx
{
  globals: {
    imports: `import { ICON_NAME, Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem, BreadcrumbLink, Icon } from '@ovhcloud/ods-react';`
  },
  tags: ['!dev'],
  parameters: {
    layout: 'centered'
  },
  render: ({}) => <Breadcrumb aria-label="Breadcrumb">
      <BreadcrumbItem>
        <BreadcrumbLink aria-label="Home" href="#">
          <Icon name={ICON_NAME.home} />
        </BreadcrumbLink>
      </BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbItem>
        <BreadcrumbLink href="#">
          Category        </BreadcrumbLink>
      </BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbItem>
        <BreadcrumbLink href="#">
          Subcategory        </BreadcrumbLink>
      </BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbItem>
        <BreadcrumbLink href="#">
          Current page        </BreadcrumbLink>
      </BreadcrumbItem>
    </Breadcrumb>
}
```

Screen readers will announce the link, the label of the first link, the list and the number of item.
