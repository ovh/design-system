# Card

_A **Card** is a versatile component designed to act as a container for various types of content, providing structure and context in a visually distinct box._

## Overview

---

The **Card** component will serve as a flexible container that can be used across different parts of an application to display information in a structured manner.

It is designed to be reusable, customizable, and responsive, as it can hold various elements like text, Medium, and other UI components.

It also provides a consistent layout and styling for presenting information in a visually appealing way.

## Usage

---

A **Card** can be used to:

-   display a wide variety of content such as a text, or other elements.
-   emphasize important content
-   visually group related content
-   guide the user toward actions
-   provide the option to navigate to more detailed content

Several elements can be used in a **Card**:

-   A title
-   A description
-   A 
-   A 
-   Extra information

All these elements are not mandatory in every **Card**.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use Card to group related content or actions into a visually distinct, contained block |
| - Combine contextually related elements inside a Card (e.g., image, title, text, CTA/button) |
| - Use Card to highlight key content, such as featured items, previews, or summaries |
| - Keep the Card layout clean and scannable, using consistent spacing and visual hierarchy |
| - Limit the number of interactive elements (e.g., buttons or links) |
| - Apply Card when you need to modularize content for dashboards, lists, or repeated patterns |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't overuse Card across the UI. They should enhance clarity, not create visual clutter |
| - Don't fill Card with unrelated or excessive content that breaks focus or structure |
| - Don't place too many buttons or CTAs within a single Card. Keep interactions minimal and purposeful |
| - Don't use Card to group inconsistent or unrelated components (e.g., mixing stats, forms, and media arbitrarily) |
| - Don't use Card to group inconsistent or unrelated components (e.g., mixing stats, forms, and media arbitrarily) |
| - Don't make the entire Card clickable unless it's meant to behave as a single interactive unit |
| - Don't apply inconsistent padding, borders, or elevation. All Cards should follow the same structural rules |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Card**
2.  **Content**

## Placement

---

**Cards** that are strongly related can be grouped in a layout group. This group can flow horizontally left to right and/or vertically top to bottom.

## Variation

---

### Color

-   **Neutral**: displaying standard content without conveying any particular status or urgency, maintaining a balanced and non-emphatic appearance.
-   **Primary**: displaying highlighted content with particular emphasis.

## Navigation

---

The **Card** component is non-interactive and does not receive keyboard focus.

## Accessibility

---

When multiple **Cards** are grouped together, it is important to ensure their structure is correctly conveyed to assistive technologies.

### Structuring groups of Cards with lists

If multiple **Cards** are displayed together (e.g., a collection of products, articles or dashboards), they should be wrapped in an unordered list of items (`<ul>` and `<li>`) to improve navigation for screen reader users.

-   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  
    Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus.
    
-   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  
    Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus.
    

```jsx
<ul
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    gap: '16px',
    listStyleType: 'none',
    margin: 0,
    padding: 0
  }}
>
  <li>
    <Card
      style={{
        padding: '8px'
      }}
    >
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.      <br />
      Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus.    </Card>
  </li>
  <li>
    <Card
      style={{
        padding: '8px'
      }}
    >
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.      <br />
      Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus.    </Card>
  </li>
</ul>
```

This structure ensures that assistive technologies announce **Cards** as a list, rather than reading them as separate, unrelated announcements. Screen readers will announce the list and the number of items.

### Alternative approach with ARIA roles

When modifying the HTML structure is not possible, use [role="list"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role) and [role="listitem"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listitem_role) to mimic list semantics.

```jsx
{
  globals: {
    imports: `import { Card } from '@ovhcloud/ods-react';`
  },
  tags: ['!dev'],
  parameters: {
    layout: 'centered'
  },
  render: ({}) => <div role="list" style={{
    display: 'flex',
    gap: '16px'
  }}>
      <Card role="listitem" style={{
      padding: '8px'
    }}>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.<br />
        Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus.      </Card>
      <Card role="listitem" style={{
      padding: '8px'
    }}>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.<br />
        Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus.      </Card>
    </div>
}
```

This ensures that screen readers still recognize the **Cards** as a structured list even without native `<ul>` and `<li>` elements.
