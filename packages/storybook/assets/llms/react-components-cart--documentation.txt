## Overview

---

The **Cart** component provides a summary of the user’s current order. It displays the selected products, their associated options, pricing details, and the overall total before checkout.

## Usage

---

Use the **Cart** component to:

-   Display products and options added to the user’s order.
-   Remove a product or an individual option from the order.
-   Provide a clear breakdown of pricing, including promotions and included items.
-   Show the total amount and allow users to continue their order.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use Cart sections (product header, options) to group related information clearly |
| - Use expand/collapse only for optional details that help users review their order without cluttering the interface |
| - Use promotions and included option labels to communicate value clearly |
| - Display footer lines for additional contextual information such as VAT, shipping, or billing details |
| - Use remove icon buttons consistently for products and options to allow quick corrections |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don’t use the Cart to display unrelated content or marketing messages |
| - Don’t include vague product or option labels since they should clearly identify the item |
| - Don’t overload the Cart with too many optional lines, which can make it hard to scan |
| - Don’t mix different types of content (e.g., recommendations) with the Cart items ? |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Cart**
2.  **Product header**
3.  **Product option list**
4.  **Footer**

## Placement

---

The **Cart** component is typically placed:

-   On the right side of the page on desktop layouts.
-   As a bottom sheet on mobile devices.

It should remain visible and easily accessible throughout the ordering flow.

## Behavior

---

### Desktop

-   The **Cart** is open and fully expanded by default.
-   Product can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide its options.
-   The **Cart** content is vertically scrollable when it exceeds the available space.
-   Clicking the product remove icon button removes the entire product and all associated options.
-   Clicking an option remove icon button removes only that option and updates the product price and **Cart** total.

### Mobile

-   The **Cart** is closed by default.
-   Only the handle and the **Cart** total area are visible while closed.
-   Users can swipe the handle to open the **Cart** and review order details.
-   While open, the **Cart** content is scrollable.
-   Users can swipe the handle again to close the **Cart**.
-   Remove icon buttons remain accessible within the **Cart** when open and expanded.

### Empty Cart

When no product is added:

-   Display a message indicating that the cart is empty.
-   Display a disabled "Continue my order" **Button**.
-   When the last product is removed, the **Cart** immediately transitions to the empty state.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

All interactive elements inside the **Cart** (expand/collapse controls, buttons) can receive keyboard focus.

The **Cart** container itself does not receive focus.

When a product header expand/collapse control is activated, the focus remains on the control and the associated product options are revealed or hidden without moving focus.

When the **Cart** is closed on mobile, only the **Cart** handle and visible interactive elements can receive focus.

When the **Cart** is open on mobile, all interactive elements inside the **Cart** become focusable.

The disabled **Button** cannot receive focus.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Tab or Shift + Tab moves focus sequentially through all interactive elements inside the **Cart**.

Pressing Enter or Space activates the currently focused element. This can:

-   Expand or collapse a product to show or hide its options.
-   Remove the associated product or option.
-   Trigger the **Cart** action button.

Pressing Escape collapses the **Cart** when it is expanded on mobile and returns focus to the **Cart** handle.

## Accessibility

---

### Announce product and option updates

When a product or option is added, removed, or when the total price changes, screen readers are not automatically informed.

To ensure users receive feedback, use a live region in your DOM and update its text content when the `Cart` changes.

```tsx
const liveRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
function updateLiveRegion() {
  if (liveRef.current) {
    liveRef.current.textContent = 'Product "My product" has been added to your cart. Total is now xx.xx€.';
  }
}
return (
  <div
    ref={ liveRef }
    role="status" />
```

Screen readers will inform users of product additions, removals, and total updates through the live region.
