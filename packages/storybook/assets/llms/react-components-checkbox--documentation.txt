Checkbox

## Overview

---

**Checkbox** are used to make a choice that must be confirmed by submitting a form. For an instantaneous choice (without submit), the use of a switch is preferred (see Switch).

## Usage

---

**Checkbox** can be used in forms and containers.

Also, it can serve as :

-   Selecting/deselecting item(s)
-   Lists/sub-lists
-   Filters
-   Agreement to terms and conditions

A **Checkbox** group is used for a list of options where the user may make a choice by selecting multiple options, including all or none.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use clear, concise, and descriptive labels to explain what the Checkbox controls |
| - Allow labels to wrap to multiple lines when necessary, readability is more important than keeping to one line here |
| - Group related Checkboxes using a fieldset with a legend to provide context when applicable |
| - Use Checkboxes when multiple selections are allowed within a group of options |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use a Checkbox if the user can only select one option, use a Radio Group instead |
| - Don't truncate labels with ellipsis |
| - Don't place Checkboxes too close together, maintain sufficient spacing to prevent selection errors |
| - Don't use Checkboxes for binary actions like "save" or "submit", use a Button instead |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Checkbox**
2.  **Label**

## Placement

---

The **Checkbox** can be autonomous, as it can be labelled in a starting/ending text.

It can be inserted in containers or next to an external item.

## Behavior

---

The default behavior is that when clicking on the **Checkbox** or its linked label, the **Checkbox** is alternatively selected or deselected depending on the previous state.

The indeterminate state is used only when the **Checkbox** contains a sub-list of selections that are partially selected.

The **Checkbox** can be in an error state, but also in a disabled state.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

The **Checkbox** component can receive keyboard focus and is part of the standard tab order.

If the **Checkbox** is disabled, it does not receive focus and cannot be activated via keyboard.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Space toggles the **Checkbox** state (checked/unchecked).

## Accessibility

---

This component complies with the [Checkbox WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/checkbox) .

Vertical spacing of at least `8px` between each checkbox is advised to provide sufficient tactile and visual separation.
