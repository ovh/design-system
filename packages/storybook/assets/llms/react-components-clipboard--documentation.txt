## Usage

---

**Clipboard** is used to quickly and easily copy an amount of text to the user's **Clipboard**.

It can be used when it is considered that it will cause trouble for the user to select and copy a text.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use the Clipboard component to allow users to easily copy non-editable text, such as tokens, or IDs |
| - Use Clipboard when copying text manually would be error-prone or tedious |
| - Use the mask/unmask toggle appropriately for sensitive content, like passwords or tokens |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use the Clipboard just to display static text, use a read-only Input or Text component instead |
| - Don't display text that should be editable in a Clipboard, this component is read-only by nature |
| - Don't place the Clipboard in contexts where copying is unnecessary or irrelevant |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Clipboard**
2.  **Input text**
3.  **Copy button**
4.  **Tooltip**
5.  **Show/Hide button** - optional

## Placement

---

By default, the **Clipboard** content is left-aligned in its container.

**Clipboard**'s Tooltip is right-aligned after the component by default, and vertically centered.

## Behavior

---

**Clipboard** can be focused and hovered. They can be disabled. When disabled, the component can't be hovered, focused nor clicked.

The **Clipboard** component is used as read-only, to allow users to copy a predefined text that cannot be edited directly.

Even if no visual indicator prompts the user to do so, the user can select the text directly in the Input.

The trigger for copying the Input field content to the **Clipboard** is the "copy" button.

When hovering or focusing, a Tooltip is displayed as a helper.

The clipboard masking toggled using show/hide action is permanent. Users have to click again to show/hide the Input field content.

A confirmation Tooltip is displayed (if user is still hovering the "copy" button) when **Clipboard** content has been successfully copied.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

The **Clipboard** receives focus as part of the natural tab order. Copy button becomes focusable immediately after the **Clipboard**.

If the **Clipboard** is disabled, it is skipped in the tab order and cannot be focused.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Ctrl + C (or Cmd + C on macOS) while the input field is focused copies the selected text.

Pressing Enter or Space when the copy button is focused triggers the copy action (button component behavior).

## Accessibility

---

To ensure proper accessibility, the **Clipboard** component must be correctly labeled.

### Always provide an explicit label

Every **Clipboard** must have a clear and explicit label to ensure that users (especially screen reader users) understand its purpose, using either **FormField** or a native label tag.

API key:

```jsx
<FormField>
  <FormFieldLabel>
    API key:  </FormFieldLabel>
  <Clipboard value="loremipsum">
    <ClipboardControl />
    <ClipboardTrigger />
  </Clipboard>
</FormField>
```

Screen readers will announce the label, the field and its content.
