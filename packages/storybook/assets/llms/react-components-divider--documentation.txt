# Divider

_A **Divider** component is a spacer used to add white space between two elements on a page._

---

## Overview

---

A **Divider** is a UI component used to separate content into clear, distinct sections, providing visual breaks between different elements or groups of content.

## Usage

---

**Divider** is used to separate content on a page.

It brings clarity to a layout by dividing content in proximity.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use a Divider to visually separate content into meaningful sections or groups |
| - Place a Divider below section titles or headers to emphasize hierarchy and structure |
| - Use Divider to indicate content boundaries without relying solely on spacing or background changes |
| - Keep Divider usage subtle and consistent across the layout to preserve clarity |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't place a Divider above section titles or headers, it breaks natural reading flow |
| - Don't overuse Dividers on a single page, too many can create visual noise and clutter |
| - Don't use Divider as a primary layout mechanism, prefer spacing, grouping, or cards for structure |
| - Don't rely on Divider to fix unclear content grouping, improve the layout or hierarchy instead |
| - Don't use Divider when spacing alone is sufficient to separate elements |
| - Don't apply inconsistent styling (e.g., thickness, color) that breaks the visual consistency of the interface |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Divider**
2.  **Spacing**

## Placement

---

Use **Divider** between closely related content blocks or UI elements to enhance readability without adding visual noise.

It works well in layouts like sidebars, menus, or cards to separate sections clearly.

## Variation

---

### Spacing

It can be adjusted around the **Divider** to match the layout and visual rhythm of the content.

### Color

-   **Light** (default): used on dark or colored backgrounds to maintain contrast
-   **Dark**: used on light backgrounds for clear, subtle separation

## Navigation

---

The **Divider** component is purely visual and does not receive keyboard focus. It serves as a separator between content sections and does not impact keyboard navigation.

## Accessibility

---

The **Divider** provides a clear visual separation between content sections which can help users with visual impairments to better understand the layout and structure of the page.
