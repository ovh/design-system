# Editable

Double click to edit

## Overview

---

The **Editable** component allows users to edit text directly in place. It replaces static text with an editable field, letting users quickly update content without opening a form or modal.

<table class="_table_4upov_2 _table--md_4upov_54 _table--striped_4upov_152 _identity-card__table_75e8e_7" data-ods="table" data-storybook="table"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Name</th><td>Editable</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Also known as</th><td>Inline Editor</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Links</th><td><a class="_link_1qra4_2 _identity-card__app-link_75e8e_12" data-ods="link" href="https://www.figma.com/design/9jDDTcR4a9jPRFcdjawAlf/branch/nrXo7riue1w773W2h4HGBS/ODS---UI-Kit?m=auto&amp;node-id=14291-46529&amp;t=rsFWlOhZe0TlF6Wd-1" target="_blank">Design <span class="_icon_1iyhc_2 _icon--external-link_1iyhc_244" data-ods="icon" role="presentation"></span></a><a class="_link_1qra4_2 _identity-card__app-link_75e8e_12" data-ods="link" href="https://github.com/ovh/design-system/tree/master/packages/ods-react/src/components/editable" target="_blank">Github<span class="_icon_1iyhc_2 _icon--external-link_1iyhc_244" data-ods="icon" role="presentation"></span></a></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Usage

---

The **Editable** component is used when users need to modify text directly in the interface, without disrupting their workflow.

They are commonly used for:

-   Inline editing of cell values in a datagrid or table (e.g., a nickname)
-   Editable titles or headings (e.g., rename a dashboard)
-   Settings panels (e.g. configuration values, such as thresholds or labels)
-   Text snippets (e.g., section titles, captions)
-   Lists and todo items

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use Editable when users need to edit values quickly and frequently. |
| - Define a reasonable max length to prevent layout overflow. |
| - Ensure editable content has a meaningful default or empty state. |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Remove visual cues that indicate editability. |
| - Use Editable for long or complex form content. |
| - Use Editable when changes must be reviewed or explicitly confirmed in a separate step. |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Editable**
2.  **Preview / Editing field**
3.  **Actions**

Preview displays static text when not in edit mode while the field is visible only during edit mode.

## Behavior

---

### Edit Activation

Users can enter edit mode through different triggers:

-   By click on the edit trigger
-   By double-click on the preview

### Editing

When entering edit mode, the preview is replaced by a field containing the current value.

Users can type in the field and update the current value.

### Submission

The editable value should be committed when the user activates the submit trigger.

### Cancellation

Activating the cancel trigger should discard the current changes and returns the component to its previous value.

### Empty

If the current value is empty, an empty state should be displayed to indicate that no content has been defined yet.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

When edit mode is entered, focus should moves to the expected field.

Exiting edit mode returns focus according to the surrounding context.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Tab moves focus forward to the next interactive element.

Pressing Shift + Tab moves focus backward to the previous interactive element.

Pressing Enter on the edit trigger activates edit mode.

Pressing Enter on the submit trigger should commit the current value and exits edit mode.

Pressing Enter on the cancel trigger should discard the current changes and exits edit mode.

## Accessibility

---

Accessibility depends on the form elements used within **Editable**. Make sure inputs, triggers and custom actions follow standard accessibility rules.
