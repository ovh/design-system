# Input

_**Input** component is an **Input** field where users can type into_

## Overview

---

An **Input** is used to allow the user to enter a single line information in a field.

<table class="_table_4upov_2 _table--md_4upov_54 _table--striped_4upov_152 _identity-card__table_75e8e_7" data-ods="table" data-storybook="table"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Name</th><td>Input</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Also known as</th><td>Text Input, Text Field</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Links</th><td><a class="_link_1qra4_2 _identity-card__app-link_75e8e_12" data-ods="link" href="https://www.figma.com/design/9jDDTcR4a9jPRFcdjawAlf/ODS---UI-Kit?node-id=93-22570" target="_blank">Design <span class="_icon_1iyhc_2 _icon--external-link_1iyhc_244" data-ods="icon" role="presentation"></span></a><a class="_link_1qra4_2 _identity-card__app-link_75e8e_12" data-ods="link" href="https://github.com/ovh/design-system/tree/master/packages/ods-react/src/components/input" target="_blank">Github <span class="_icon_1iyhc_2 _icon--external-link_1iyhc_244" data-ods="icon" role="presentation"></span></a><a class="_link_1qra4_2 _identity-card__app-link_75e8e_12" data-ods="link" href="https://ovh.github.io/design-system/v18.6.4/?path=/docs/ods-components-form-elements-input--documentation" target="_blank">Previous major version<span class="_icon_1iyhc_2 _icon--external-link_1iyhc_244" data-ods="icon" role="presentation"></span></a></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Usage

---

An **Input** is used to type a free-form short text in a field. It is often used within a Form Field component that adds its label.

It is commonly used in a form, such as asking the user their name or email address, data entered can be text or numbers.

The **Input** component can be used in addition with an **Autocomplete**.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Always pair the Input with a clear and explicit label, using the Form Field component for example |
| - Provide a helper message or validation feedback below the Input when appropriate (e.g., expected format or error state) |
| - Use the clearable button option when it helps users reset the field quickly and efficiently |
| - Use the toggle mask button for sensitive inputs to let users show or hide the content |
| - Include a search button within the Input if a specific action is expected (e.g., triggering a search) |
| - Choose the appropriate input type (email, password, search, etc.) to support native validation |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use an Input for multi-line content, use a Textarea instead |
| - Don't use an Input when users must choose from a predefined set of answers. Prefer Select, Combobox, or Radio |
| - Don't leave an Input without a label |
| - Don't overload the Input with multiple embedded actions (e.g., clear + search + toggle) since it creates visual clutter |
| - Don't use an Input that is inappropriately sized for its content |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Input**
2.  **Placeholder or input text**
3.  **Clearable button** - optional

## Placement

---

**Input** should be vertically aligned with other form components on a same page.

**Inputs** that are strongly related in a form can be grouped. This group can flow horizontally left to right and/or vertically top to bottom.

## Behavior

---

**Inputs** can be hovered, focused and clicked / triggered. They can be disabled or readonly as well.

The user can start typing in the **Input** after clicking or focusing on the field container.

A clearable button can be displayed within the **Input** to clear its content. This button becomes visible as soon as the user types the first character and removes all content when clicked.

A toggle mask button can be displayed within the **Input** to toggle the visibility of its content, such as revealing or hiding a password in a masked input.

A search button can be displayed within the **Input** to trigger a specific action, such as performing a search.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

The **Input** field receives focus as part of the natural tab order.

If a clear button is present, it becomes focusable immediately after the **Input** field.

If a toggle mask button (show/hide password) is present, it becomes focusable after the clear button.

If a search button is present, it becomes focusable after the other **Input** action buttons.

If the **Input** field is read-only, it can still receive focus but cannot be edited.

If the **Input** is disabled, it is skipped in the tab order and cannot be edited.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Tab moves focus forward.

Pressing Shift + Tab moves focus backward to the previous interactive element.

Typing any character while the **Input** field is focused enters text into the field.

Pressing Backspace deletes the character preceding the cursor.

Pressing Enter while a clear, toggle mask, or search button is focused triggers the corresponding action.

## Accessibility

---

To ensure proper accessibility, the **Input** component must be correctly labeled and provide meaningful context when interactive elements (such as icon buttons) are used.

### Always provide an explicit label

Every **Input** must have a clear and explicit label to ensure that users (especially screen reader users) understand its purpose, using either **FormField** or a native label tag.

Name:

```jsx
<FormField>
  <FormFieldLabel>
    Name:  </FormFieldLabel>
  <Input />
</FormField>
```

Screen readers will announce the label, the field and its content.

### Override action context

To provide more context on the interactive elements, you can provide your own custom translations to the component.

```jsx
<FormField>
  <FormFieldLabel>
    Search:  </FormFieldLabel>
  <Input clearable defaultValue="my search" i18n={{
  [INPUT_I18N.clearButton]: 'Clear current search',
  [INPUT_I18N.searchButton]: 'Search in database'
}} type='search' />
</FormField>
```

Screen readers will announce the label, the field, its content and custom label of focused action.
