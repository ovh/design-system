## Usage

---

Use the **Logo** component to display the brand identity in key areas of the interface, such as headers, navigation bars, footers, or branded sections.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use the Logo component to represent the brand identity consistently across your interfaces |
| - Choose the appropriate variant based on available space and hierarchy |
| - Ensure adequate spacing around the logo so it remains clearly visible and legible |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Do not change logo colors outside of the approved brand versions |
| - Do not use the Logo as an interactive element (button or link) unless explicitly wrapped by a dedicated navigation component |
| - Do not overcrowd the logo with surrounding content |

## Placement

---

The **Logo** component can be used in various layouts, including:

-   Application headers and top navigation bars
-   Sidebars
-   Footers
-   Splash screens or landing pages
-   Branded sections within a page

## Variation

---

### Variant

#### Emblem

Displays the logo emblem only. Best suited for compact spaces (e.g. collapsed navigation, mobile headers, favicon-like usage).

#### Default

Displays the logo emblem and wordmark horizontally.

Recommended for standard headers and navigation bars where horizontal space is available.

### Size

#### Small

Use in constrained spaces such as mobile headers, compact navigation bars, or secondary branding areas.

#### Medium

Default choice for standard application headers and footers.

#### Large

Use for high-visibility contexts such as landing pages, splash screens, or branded hero sections.

## Navigation

---

The **Logo** component is non-interactive and does not receive keyboard focus. It is used solely for displaying the brand identity and does not impact keyboard navigation.

If the logo needs to act as a link (e.g. redirect to the homepage), it must be wrapped in a separate interactive element that handles navigation and focus.

## Accessibility

---

When the logo is used within a navigational element (for example, as a link in a header), an `aria-label` on the link should reflect the intended action, such as:

-   "Navigate to the homepage"
-   "Return to the [Brand name] home page"

[](https://www.ovhcloud.com)

```jsx
<a
  aria-label="Return to the OVHcloud home page"
  href="https://www.ovhcloud.com"
>
  <Logo />
</a>
```

Screen readers will announce the `aria-label`.
