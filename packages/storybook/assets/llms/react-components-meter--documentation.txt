# Meter

## Overview

---

The **Meter** component visually represents a quantitative value within a defined range.

## Usage

---

The **Meter** component represents a quantitative value such as resource usage, storage availability, or other bounded metrics. It is distinct from a progress bar due to its focus on measurement and thresholds rather than progress toward a goal.

Additionally, the **Meter** is primarily static, representing a fixed state or measurement, whereas the progress bar is dynamic, reflecting continuous updates or progress over time.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use the Meter to represent bounded measurements, such as disk usage or CPU load |
| - Customize thresholds and colors to provide meaningful visual cues |
| - Include appropriate labels when context is not immediately clear |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| Don't use a Meter to represent unbounded progress (use a progress bar instead) |
| Avoid separating the Meter and its associated value across different sections of the UI to prevent confusion |
| Avoid excessive customization that compromises readability or accessibility |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Meter**
2.  **Track**
3.  **Fill**

## Placement

---

The placement of the **Meter** depends on its use case and the context within the UI.

Place the **Meter** close to the element it represents (e.g., near a resource title).

If the **Meter** is tied to a specific numeric value (e.g., "75% used"), display the value nearby for clarity, directly adjacent to the component.

Include appropriate labels when context is not immediately clear:

-   inline: labels can be placed above, below or beside the Meter.
-   surrounding: labels for minimum and maximum values can be positioned at opposite ends of the track, as needed.
-   hidden: for visual-only representation.

## Behavior

---

Value representation supports minimum, maximum, and current value inputs. The filled portion of the **Meter** is dynamically adjusted based on the value.

Low and high thresholds can be specified to visually indicate important ranges. Color will change based on those thresholds.

The coloring behavior may be updated through the optimum attribute. See the [optimum documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meter#optimum) for more information.

## Navigation

---

The **Meter** component is non-interactive and does not receive keyboard focus.

## Accessibility

---

To ensure proper accessibility, **Meter** must be correctly labeled.

### Always provide an explicit label

Every **Meter** must have a clear and explicit label to ensure that users (especially screen reader users) understand its purpose, using either an [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or an [aria-labelledby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute.

```jsx
<Meter
  aria-label="Gauge"
  low={40}
  value={35}
/>
```

Screen readers will announce the label and the meter information.

Gauge:

```jsx
<>
  <Text
    id="meter-label"
    preset="label"
  >
    Gauge:  </Text>
  <Meter
    aria-labelledby="meter-label"
    low={40}
    value={35}
  />
</>
```

Screen readers will announce the label and the meter information.

### Improve value readability

Numbers aren't always user-friendly. You can use the [aria-valuetext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuetext) attribute to present the current value in a more user-friendly, human-understandable way.

```jsx
<Meter
  aria-label="Gauge"
  aria-valuetext="35 files uploaded"
  low={40}
  value={35}
/>
```

Screen readers will announce the label and the meter information in a more user-friendly, human-understandable way.
