# Modal

_A **Modal** component is used to overlay with important content the main view of a site and block interactions with it._

## Overview

---

A **Modal** is used to provide some information to users that needs a response or immediate attention.

While a **Modal** is triggered, there is no interaction possible on the page that is overlaid so users have to dismiss or click on an action Button to proceed further.

## Usage

---

**Modals** are used in different cases:

-   alerting users about something that requires their agreement
-   confirming a user decision
-   notifying the user of important information

They can be dismissable or not.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use a Modal to capture user attention for critical decisions, confirmations, or required input that blocks the current flow |
| - Ensure the Modal has a clear and focused purpose, with concise messaging and a single main action |
| - Allow the Modal to be dismissed via a cancel button, close icon, or Escape key, unless a decision is mandatory |
| - Keep Modal content short and scannable. Support scroll only when necessary |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use Modals for non-interruptive information, prefer inline content or a Message component for passive feedback |
| - Don't trigger a second Modal from within another Modal since this leads to confusion and poor accessibility |
| - Don't use Modals for long-form content like documentation, complex forms, or multiple paragraphs. Consider a dedicated page or Drawer instead |
| - Don't make a Modal dismissible if the user must take an action to proceed and ensure the intent is clear |
| - Don't overload the Modal with multiple CTAs (Call-to-Action) or overly complex UI elements |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Modal**
2.  **Header**
3.  **Close button** - optional
4.  **Content**
5.  **Title & description**
6.  **Actions**

## Placement

---

When a **Modal** opening is triggered, it is displayed with a position aligned both horizontally and vertically within the viewport.

**Modal** takes up 100% of the viewport width up to a maximum width of 512px.

On smaller screens, the **Modal** takes all the available space with a margin of 16px.

## Behavior

---

### Overlay

A background overlay with opacity is displayed on the page to avoid distraction and help users to focus on the **Modal** content.

An animation with the ease-in and out effect applies on opening.

### Closing

A **Modal** is dismissed by clicking on the close icon button.

Dismissing a **Modal** means that it will be closed without submitting any data and the user won't proceed further.

A **Modal** will be successfully closed only once the required action or response has been completed by the user, meaning that the task is completed so the user will proceed further.

The hidden overflow behavior is removed whenever the **Modal** get closed.

### Scrolling

When necessary, depending on the viewport height and the **Modal** content, the user can scroll vertically with the header and the action button remaining in place.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

When the **Modal** is opened, focus is automatically set to the **Modal** itself.

Focus is trapped within the **Modal** and its inner elements while it remains open.

When the **Modal** is closed, focus returns to the trigger element unless otherwise specified.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Escape closes the **Modal** (if dismissible)

Pressing Tab moves focus forward:

-   First to the close icon button (if available)
-   Then through any other focusable elements inside the **Modal** (e.g., buttons, inputs)

Pressing Shift + Tab moves focus backward through the focusable elements.

Once the last focusable element is reached, focus loops back to the first focusable element, ensuring it remains within the **Modal**.

## Accessibility

---

This component complies with the [Modal WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/) .

### Linking the Modal title and content

Ensure that assistive technologies announce the **Modal** correctly using [aria-labelledby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) or [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) , and [aria-describedby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) .

```jsx
<Modal>
  <ModalTrigger asChild>
    <Button>
      Trigger Modal    </Button>
  </ModalTrigger>
  <ModalContent
    aria-describedby="modal-content"
    aria-label="Modal Content"
  >
    <ModalHeader>
      Modal header    </ModalHeader>
    <ModalBody id="modal-content">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.    </ModalBody>
  </ModalContent>
</Modal>
```

```jsx
<Modal>
  <ModalTrigger asChild>
    <Button>
      Trigger Modal    </Button>
  </ModalTrigger>
  <ModalContent
    aria-describedby="modal-content"
    aria-labelledby="modal-title"
  >
    <ModalHeader>
      <span id="modal-title">
        Delete item      </span>
    </ModalHeader>
    <ModalBody>
      <p id="modal-content">
        Are you sure you want to delete this item? This action cannot be undone.      </p>
    </ModalBody>
  </ModalContent>
</Modal>
```

Screen readers will announce the sections referenced by the aria attributes.

### Prioritize the least critical action in modal buttons

For **Modals** that require user decisions (e.g., confirmation dialogs), place the least critical **Button** first in the **Modal** actions section.

```jsx
<Modal>
  <ModalTrigger asChild>
    <Button>
      Trigger Modal    </Button>
  </ModalTrigger>
  <ModalContent color="critical">
    <ModalHeader>
      <span id="modal-title">
        Delete item      </span>
    </ModalHeader>
    <ModalBody>
      <p id="modal-content">
        Are you sure you want to delete this item?      </p>
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'flex',
          gap: '8px',
          justifyContent: 'end'
        }}
      >
        <Button variant="ghost">
          Cancel        </Button>
        <Button color="critical">
          Delete        </Button>
      </div>
    </ModalBody>
  </ModalContent>
</Modal>
```

Users will first encounter the non-destructive action (e.g., "Cancel"), reducing accidental confirmations.
