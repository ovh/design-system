# Progress Bar

_A horizontal bar indicating the current completion status of a long-running task, usually updated continuously as the task progresses, instead of in discrete steps._

## Overview

---

The **Progress Bar** component is used to indicate the progress of a task or process to users. It visually represents the completion percentage, providing users with feedback on the status of ongoing operations, such as file uploads, downloads, or form submissions.

## Usage

---

**Progress Bar** component is only used in process progression, such as submitting, uploading or saving items.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use a Progress Bar to represent linear, quantifiable progression in processes like uploads or submissions |
| - Prefer Progress Bar when the completion state is measurable (e.g. 0–100%), and users benefit from visual feedback on progress |
| - Use clear labels or indicators (like percentage or step descriptions) if it adds clarity to the task |
| - Pair the Progress Bar with contextual messaging to clarify what is being processed and what happens next |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use a Progress Bar to visualize static data or compare values, use a chart or graph instead |
| - Don't display all three labels (start value, end value, current value) at the same time |
| - Don't rely solely on color to communicate progress, include text or value where helpful |
| - Don't use Progress Bar for instantaneous actions where progress feedback is not meaningful, use a spinner instead |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Progress Bar**
2.  **Track**
3.  **Progress fill**

## Placement

---

**Progress Bar** is usually centered in its container, and can be stretched to match the container width if necessary.

## Behavior

---

**Progress Bar** is filled from the minimum to the maximum value, depending on the progress described.

## Navigation

---

The **Progress Bar** component is non-interactive and does not receive keyboard focus. It is purely visual and used to indicate progress status without affecting keyboard navigation.

## Accessibility

---

**Progress Bar** component should be properly identified and structured to ensure it is accessible to assistive technologies.

### Linking the Progress Bar to loading details

To ensure the **Progress Bar** is correctly recognized, an [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) should be added to explicitly identify it.

```jsx
<ProgressBar aria-label="Converting" />
```

Screen readers will announce the label, the value and the progress bar.
