## Overview

---

The **Range** component is used for selecting a numerical value or a range of values within a specified range.

It provides a visual and interactive way to adjust values, often used in forms, settings, and data filtering.

The component can support single-value sliders or dual-handle sliders for selecting ranges.

## Usage

---

A **Range** is used to select a numeric value within a given range with defined minimum and maximum values.

It is easily adjustable in a visually pleasing interface and, after interacting with it, changes are reflected immediately.

A dual **Range** allows the user to select a numeric range value that is no less than a given value, and no more than another given value.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use a Range component when users need to select a value (or values) within a defined numeric interval |
| - Label the Range clearly using a Form Field to indicate what the value represents |
| - Provide a default value or starting range to guide users and avoid ambiguity |
| - Use a dual Range when allowing users to set a minimum and maximum value |
| - Make sure the Range has enough horizontal space to be usable and legible |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't overload a page with too many Range components |
| - Don't place a Range in tight or constrained spaces where the control becomes hard to use or interpret |
| - Don't use a continuous Range for large intervals where precision is important. Use a discrete step Range or typed input instead |
| - Don't omit labels or helper text |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Range**
2.  **Track**
3.  **Min/Max values**
4.  **Handle**
5.  **Active fill**
6.  **Second handle** - optional (Dual Range)
7.  **Tick marks** - optional

## Placement

---

A **Range** can be used in a page as long as there is a need to allow users to select a numeric value within a given range, for a quantity or a volume for example.

It has a width by default, but it can widen to match its container.

The **Range** can also be used inside components.

It also can be combined with other elements such as an input for a better control of the value selection.

## Behavior

---

A **Range** can be focused and hovered. It also can be disabled.

The user can select a numeric value by clicking and dragging the thumb along the track.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

The **Range** component can be focused. Focus will land on the first thumb if multiple are present.

When multiple thumbs are used, each thumb can receive focus individually.

Disabled **Range** and disabled thumbs cannot be focused or interacted with.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Arrow Right or Arrow Up increases the value of the focused thumb by one step.

Pressing Arrow Left or Arrow Down decreases the value of the focused thumb by one step.

Pressing Page Up or Shift + Arrow Right increases the value by a larger step.

Pressing Page Down or Shift + Arrow Down decreases the value by a larger step.

Pressing Home or fn + Arrow Left sets the value to the minimum.

Pressing End or fn + Arrow Right sets the value to the maximum.

Pressing Tab and Shift + Tab allow navigation between multiple thumbs (if present).

## Accessibility

---

This component complies with the [Slider](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/) and [Slider (Multi-Thumb)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider-multithumb/) WAI-ARIA design patterns.

### Always provide an explicit label

Every **Range** must have a clear and explicit label to ensure that users (especially screen reader users) understand its purpose, using either **FormField** or a native label tag.

Volume

0100

```jsx
<FormField>
  <FormFieldLabel>
    Volume  </FormFieldLabel>
  <Range
    defaultValue={[
      50
    ]}
   />
</FormField>
```

Screen readers will announce the value, the slider and its label.

### Always provide a descriptive sub-label in Dual Range

Sub-label provide additional context about the values that are selected or adjusted by the user. This sub-label should be vocalized by screen readers. Use [aria-labelledby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) to link the sub-label and [aria-live="polite"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions) to ensure that the content is vocalized by screen readers.

Price rangeSelected values: 30 - 70€

0100

```jsx
const [values, setValues] = useState([30, 70]);
  return <FormField>
      <FormFieldLabel id="range-label">
        Price range      </FormFieldLabel>
      <Text aria-live="polite" id="range-sublabel" preset={TEXT_PRESET.caption}>
        Selected values: {values[0]} - {values[1]}€
      </Text>
      <Range aria-labelledby={['range-label', 'range-sublabel']} onDragging={({
      value    }) => setValues(value)} value={values} />
    </FormField>;
}
```

Screen readers will announce the values, the slider and its label.
