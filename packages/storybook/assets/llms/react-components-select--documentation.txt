## Overview

---

A **Select** is used to allow users to select one or more items from a list that is displayed after clicking on it.

## Usage

---

A **Select** is used to display to the user a list of items or options to choose from.

The order of items or options in the list should be sorted as following, depending on the usage:

-   **Frequency** of use: recommended item will be listed first
-   **Alpha**: it can be used for countries or city locations for example
-   **Numeric**: it can be used for sizes for example

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use a Select when users need to choose one option from a list of three or more items |
| - Order the options logically (e.g., by frequency of use, alphabetical order, or numeric sequence) |
| - Keep option labels short and scannable, ideally one word or a short phrase that fits on a single line |
| - Use placeholder text to prompt users when no option is selected |
| - Consider adding grouping if you have many related options and want to improve clarity |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use a Select for binary choices like "Yes" or "No". Use Radio buttons instead for faster interaction |
| - Don't use Select when users need to compare all available options. Use Radio buttons for better visibility |
| - Don't include very long option labels that wrap multiple lines since it makes scanning and selection harder |
| - Don't rely only on placeholder text to communicate intent. Always pair Select with a label |
| - Don't overload Select with too many items (e.g., hundreds). Consider Combobox or a searchable alternative |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Select**
2.  **Field containing placeholder or selection**
3.  **Dropdown**
4.  **List**
5.  **Option**
6.  **Group** - optional
7.  **Multi-selection** - optional (display a checkbox)

## Placement

---

**Select** should be vertically aligned with other form components on a same page.

It has a width by default, but it can widen to match its container.

## Behavior

---

**Select** can be focused and hovered. It also can be disabled. A single option and a group of options can be disabled to be more precise in inner **Select** items.

## Variation

---

-   **Single selection**: Allows the user to select a single item from a dropdown list of options.
-   **Multiple selection**: Allows the user to select multiple items from a dropdown list of options. The whole line is clickable.
-   **Grouped options**: Related options can be grouped together in both a single and multi **Select**.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

When the **Select** is enabled, it can receive focus via keyboard interaction.

When the **Select** is opened, focus moves into the dropdown content and highlights the selected option (if any), or the first available option.

When closed, focus returns to the **Select** trigger.

A read-only **Select** can receive focus, but the dropdown cannot be opened or interacted with.

Disabled **Select** or disabled options cannot receive focus or be interacted with.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Space, Enter, Arrow Down or Arrow Up when the **Select** is focused opens the dropdown and highlights the selected or first option.

While the dropdown is open:

-   Arrow Down moves the highlight to the next option
-   Arrow Up moves the highlight to the previous option
-   Enter or Tab selects the currently highlighted option and closes the dropdown
-   Escape closes the dropdown without making a new selection

Typing an alphanumeric character (A–Z, a–z) changes focus to the next option starting with that character.

## Accessibility

---

This component complies with the [Listbox WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/) .

### Always provide an explicit label

Every **Select** must have a clear and explicit label to ensure that users (especially screen reader users) understand its purpose, using either **FormField** or a native label tag.

Select a Web hosting

1 vCore 2,4 GHz, 2 Go RAM1 vCore 2,4 GHz, 4 Go RAM2 vCores 2,4 GHz, 8 Go RAM

```jsx
<FormField>
  <FormFieldLabel>
    Select a Web hosting  </FormFieldLabel>
  <Select
    items={[
      {
        label: '1 vCore 2,4 GHz, 2 Go RAM',
        value: 'hosting-1'
      },
      {
        label: '1 vCore 2,4 GHz, 4 Go RAM',
        value: 'hosting-2'
      },
      {
        label: '2 vCores 2,4 GHz, 8 Go RAM',
        value: 'hosting-3'
      }
    ]}
  >
    <SelectControl />
    <SelectContent />
  </Select>
</FormField>
```

Screen readers will announce the label as well as the select.
