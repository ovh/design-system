React Components

# Switch

_A **Switch** allows users to quickly and easily switch between several states, actions or options in a row._

Component is now deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. You can use different components instead depending on your use-case:

-   managing navigation: move to  using the switch variant.
-   managing option activation: move to a .
-   as a form element: move to a .

## Overview

A **Switch** allows users to quickly and easily switch between several states, actions or options in a row.

## Usage

---

A **Switch** is used to switch between multiple states, actions or options (up-to 4).

It can be used for many use cases such as selecting a state within a group of states or filtering.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use a Switch when the user must choose one active option among 2 to 4 closely related states or actions |
| - Ensure each Switch item has a clear, descriptive label |
| - Use a Switch when immediate feedback or real-time filtering is expected upon selection |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use a Switch for more than 4 options. Prefer Radio Group, Checkbox, or Select instead depending on your use case |
| - Don't use a Switch for unrelated options, they should belong to a common category or context |
| - Don't use a Switch if selecting an option does not produce an immediate effect. Use a Checkbox or another control instead |
| - Don't rely solely on icons, add text for clarity |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Switch**
2.  **Active toggle button**
3.  **Toggle button**
4.  **Label**

## Placement

---

A **Switch** can be used in a page when the user needs to select a choice from multiple states or items. It may replace two radio buttons or a single checkbox to allow users to choose between several states.

By default, the width of a **Switch** item is defined by the length of content. A custom width can be set so all items on the track will have the same size regardless of content length.

## Behavior

---

The user can switch between states by clicking the **Switch** items, and it has an immediate effect.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

When the **Switch** receives focus, it is set on the currently selected item, or on the first item if none is selected.

Each individual **Switch** item is focusable unless disabled. A disabled item cannot receive focus or be activated.

Focus remains within the group when navigating between items using arrow keys.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Tab moves focus to the selected item or the first item in the group.

Pressing Shift + Tab moves focus to the previous focusable element outside the **Switch** group.

Pressing Arrow Right or Arrow Down moves focus to the next item in the group.

Pressing Arrow Left or Arrow Up moves focus to the previous item in the group.

Pressing Home (or fn + Arrow Left) moves focus to the first item.

Pressing End (or fn + Arrow Right) moves focus to the last item.

Pressing Space or Enter activates or deactivates the focused item, updating the selection immediately.

## Accessibility

---

To ensure proper accessibility, **Switch** must be correctly labeled.

### Always provide an explicit label

Every **Switch** must have a clear and explicit label to ensure that users (especially screen reader users) understand its purpose, using either an [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or an [aria-labelledby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute.

```jsx
<Switch aria-label="Select an item">
  <SwitchItem value="item-1">
    Item 1  </SwitchItem>
  <SwitchItem value="item-2">
    Item 2  </SwitchItem>
  <SwitchItem value="item-3">
    Item 3  </SwitchItem>
</Switch>
```

Screen readers will announce the label and the option information (text, position, selection state).

Select an item:

```jsx
<>
  <Text
    id="switch-label"
    preset="label"
  >
    Select an item:  </Text>
  <Switch aria-labelledby="switch-label">
    <SwitchItem value="item-1">
      Item 1    </SwitchItem>
    <SwitchItem value="item-2">
      Item 2    </SwitchItem>
    <SwitchItem value="item-3">
      Item 3    </SwitchItem>
  </Switch>
</>
```

Screen readers will announce the label and the option information (text, position, selection state).
