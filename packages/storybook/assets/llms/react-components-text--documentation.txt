_The **Text** component is used to display and style text content within an application._

## Overview

---

The **Text** component is a fundamental UI element for displaying text content.

It supports various presets of styles, sizes, and weights to cater to different textual content requirements such as paragraphs, headings, and inline text.

The component can be extra customized to fit the design and branding needs of the application.

## Usage

---

The **Text** component provides predefined text styles (font size, color, weight, etc.) to ensure visual consistency across the application.

It is ideal when you want to apply a ready-made text style from the OVHcloud Design System without manually setting typography values.

It is not meant for custom typography needs like overriding styles to match a specific heading or layout.

If the available presets don't fit your use case, use the appropriate semantic HTML tag with your own styling instead.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use Text presets to ensure visual and semantic consistency across your UI |
| - Respect a logical heading hierarchy (e.g., h2 follows h1, etc.) for accessibility and SEO |
| - Use Text component to convey meaning and structure, not only appearance |
| - Choose the appropriate preset for readability and emphasis, depending on the context |
| - Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background for readability and accessibility |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't skip heading levels (e.g., using heading-3 directly after heading-1), this harms accessibility and user comprehension |
| - Don't override the semantic tag of a preset (e.g., using heading-2 styled as a div) |
| - Don't use Text components just to apply a visual style, consider whether semantic meaning is appropriate |
| - Don't use too many different font sizes and weights on a single view, it creates visual noise and weakens the hierarchy |

## Placement

---

**Text** can be used everywhere in a page as long as levels and heading hierarchy are respected.

It can stand alone or be included in other components depending on the usage.

## Behavior

---

Based on its informational manner, the **Text** default behavior is being read-only.

The user can only select its content if needed.

## Navigation

---

The **Text** component is non-interactive and does not receive keyboard focus. It is purely visual and serves to display textual content without affecting keyboard navigation.

## Accessibility
