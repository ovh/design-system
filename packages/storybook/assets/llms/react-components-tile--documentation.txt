## Usage

---

**Tile** is typically used to display a small set of options. Common use cases include:

-   forms
-   surveys
-   preference or configuration screens

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use the Tile component when you need to present a limited number of options to the user, especially when those options require a brief description or additional information |
| - Use a Tile with a checkbox for multiple selections, and with a radio button for single selections |
| - Ensure that the content within Tile is concise and relevant to the user's decision-making process |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Avoid using the Tile component for complex or lengthy content, as it may overwhelm the user |
| - Do not use the Tile for options that require a high level of detail or explanation; instead, consider using a different component or providing additional context through Tooltips or Popovers |
| - Refrain from mixing checkbox and radio button in Tiles within the same selection group, as this can cause confusion |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Tile**

## Placement

---

The **Tile** component can be used in various layouts, including but not limited to, grids, lists, and as standalone elements within a form. When displaying multiple **Tiles**, ensure they are evenly spaced and aligned to provide a clear and organized user interface. Consider responsive behavior so **Tiles** remain usable and readable on smaller screens.

## Behavior

---

**Tile** component can be selected and disabled.

When selected, **Tile** displays a clear visual indication of its selected state.

When disabled, **Tile** does not respond to user interaction and cannot be selected. All content inside the **Tile** is visually and functionally disabled.

**Tile** can contain any type of content, including interactive elements.

### Navigation

#### Focus Management

**Tile** follows standard keyboard navigation patterns defined by its usage context.

## Accessibility

---

Interactive elements inside **Tile** must follow a logical tab order. Inner interactive content must remain accessible to assistive technologies, without interfering with the **Tile** selection state.
