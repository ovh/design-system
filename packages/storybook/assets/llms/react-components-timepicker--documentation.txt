# Timepicker

_A **Timepicker** is a component that allows users to select a time from a list or set a specific time._

## Overview

---

The **Timepicker** component is used for selecting times in forms and applications. It provides an interface for users to choose a time, ensuring the format is consistent and valid. The component can include features like 12-hour or 24-hour formats, increments, and disabled times.

## Usage

---

**Timepicker** is used to allow a selection of a specific time.

It is useful for scheduling such as planning a meeting.

A **Timepicker** field includes the hour, minutes and optionally seconds. It can be followed by an AM/PM indicator.

For some use case, an optional timezone Select can be added to allow users to select their desired timezone from a list of options.

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use a Timepicker when users need to select a specific time, especially for scheduling or planning scenarios |
| - Always pair the Timepicker with a clear label and/or helper text |
| - Combine the Timepicker with a datepicker when both date and time selection are needed in the same context |
| - When offering timezone selection, provide a restricted and relevant list to avoid overwhelming users. Limit options based on business relevance or geography |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use a placeholder as a label since it disappears on input and fails accessibility standards |
| - Don't rely on a placeholder to convey critical information like format or timezone. This should be communicated through helper text or labels |
| - Don't use a Timepicker for ambiguous or unclear time selection use cases. Ensure it is the right fit for your form flow and user intent |
| - Don't expose all global timezones unless necessary |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Timepicker**
2.  **Input field**
3.  **Timezones select** - optional

## Placement

---

A **Timepicker** can be used in a page as long as there is a need to allow users to pick a time.

The time field has a fixed width by default but, when used in a form, its width should match the other inputs.

**Timepicker** should be vertically aligned with other form components on a same page.

## Behavior

---

A **Timepicker** can widen to match its container (width of the elements is 50% each).

It has the same states and behaviors for each inner component (i.e.  and ).

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

When the **Timepicker** is focused, the first focusable segment (typically the hour Input) receives focus automatically.

Focus then moves sequentially through the minute and second inputs (if present), followed by the AM/PM toggle (depending on the browser) and the optional timezone select.

Each individual segment can receive focus and be navigated independently using the keyboard. If a segment (e.g., seconds or timezone) is not visible or disabled, it is skipped in the tab order.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Tab moves focus forward through all focusable segments of the Timepicker:

-   Hour field
-   Minute field
-   Second field (if enabled)
-   AM/PM toggle (if 12-hour format)
-   Time zone Select (if present)

Pressing Shift + Tab moves focus backward through the segments.

When focused on an input segment (hour, minute, second):

-   Typing numeric values replaces the current value
-   Pressing Arrow Up increments the value
-   Pressing Arrow Down decrements the value
-   Pressing Backspace clears the content
-   Pressing Home or fn + Arrow Up increases the value by:
    -   3 units for the hour segment
    -   10 units for minutes and seconds
-   Pressing End or fn + Arrow Down decreases the value by:
    -   3 units for the hour segment
    -   10 units for minutes and seconds

When focused on the AM/PM toggle:

-   Pressing Arrow Up or Arrow Down switches between AM and PM

When focused on the timezone Select, keyboard shortcuts are similar to the Select component:

-   Pressing Space or Arrow Down opens the dropdown
-   Arrow keys navigate options
-   Enter or Tab selects the option and closes the dropdown
-   Pressing Escapecloses the dropdown

## Accessibility

---

To ensure proper accessibility, the **Timepicker** component must be correctly labeled.

### Always provide an explicit label

Every **Timepicker** must have a clear and explicit label to ensure that users (especially screen reader users) understand its purpose, using either **FormField** or a native label tag.

Starting time:

UTC-12UTC-11UTC-10UTC-9UTC-8UTC-7UTC-6UTC-5UTC-4UTC-3UTC-2UTC-1UTC+0UTC+1UTC+2UTC+3UTC+4UTC+5UTC+6UTC+7UTC+8UTC+9UTC+10UTC+11UTC+12

```jsx
<FormField>
  <FormFieldLabel>
    Starting time:  </FormFieldLabel>
  <Timepicker withSeconds>
    <TimepickerControl />
    <TimepickerTimezoneList />
  </Timepicker>
</FormField>
```

Screen readers will announce the label, the input time and the select field.
