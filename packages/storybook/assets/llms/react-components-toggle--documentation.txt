React Components

# Toggle

## Overview

---

The **Toggle** component is used to enable or disable a state, setting or feature.

It provides a clear visual indication of the current state and allows users to change states with a single click or tap.

**Toggles** are commonly used in settings, preferences, and forms where a binary choice is required.

## Usage

---

A **Toggle** is commonly used for binary choice.

The user can decide to switch between two states with an immediate effect visible at a glance.

It can be used in following use cases when you need to allow the user to:

-   turn an option or settings on or off
-   add or remove an item or an option

A **Toggle** should never require users to press a button to apply their settings (if a setting requires a button, use a checkbox instead).

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use a Toggle to switch between two states when the change has an immediate effect (e.g., turning a setting on or off) |
| - Ensure the Toggle label clearly describes the "on" state, so users understand what enabling it will do |
| - Place any related elements (e.g., changes triggered by the Toggle) close to the Toggle to reinforce the connection visually |
| - Use Toggle in mobile-friendly settings where quick, touch-based interactions are expected |
| - Use Toggle in forms only when the change takes effect immediately and does not require submission to apply |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don't use a Toggle for changes that only take effect after form submission. Use a Checkbox instead |
| - Don't use ambiguous or overly long labels |
| - Don't use Toggle for multi-state or complex options since it is meant for binary (on/off) interactions only |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Toggle**
2.  **Handle**
3.  **Track**
4.  **State label** - optional

## Placement

---

Place the **Toggle** component near the setting or feature it controls.

It should be positioned within forms, settings panels, or any relevant context where a binary choice is required.

Ensure it is easily accessible and visible.

## Behavior

---

When the user clicks on a **Toggle**, it has an immediate effect:

-   set to "on" position, the thumb will slide to the right of the track
-   set to "off" position, the thumb will slide to the left of the track

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

When the **Toggle** component is focused, focus is automatically set to the **Toggle** itself.

A disabled **Toggle** cannot receive focus and cannot be toggled.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Tab moves focus to the **Toggle** component.

Pressing Shift + Tab moves focus backward to the previous focusable element.

When focused, pressing Space or Enter immediately changes the **Toggle**'s state from on to off or off to on.

## Accessibility

---

This component complies with the [Checkbox WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/checkbox) .

### Always provide an explicit label

Every **Toggle** must have a clear and explicit label to ensure that users (especially screen reader users) understand its purpose, using either a **ToggleLabel** or an [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) for context.

```jsx
{
  globals: {
    imports: `import { Toggle, ToggleControl, ToggleLabel } from '@ovhcloud/ods-react';`
  },
  tags: ['!dev'],
  render: ({}) => <Toggle>
      <ToggleControl />
      <ToggleLabel>
        Enable dark mode      </ToggleLabel>
    </Toggle>
}
```

Screen readers will announce a checkbox, its state and the label.

Dark mode

```jsx
{
  globals: {
    imports: `import { Toggle, ToggleControl, ToggleLabel } from '@ovhcloud/ods-react';`
  },
  tags: ['!dev'],
  render: ({}) => <Toggle aria-label="Enable dark mode">
      <ToggleControl />
      <ToggleLabel>
        Dark mode      </ToggleLabel>
    </Toggle>
}
```

Screen readers will announce a checkbox, its state and the label.
