## Overview

---

The **Tree View** component displays hierarchical data in a parent-child structure. It allows users to expand, collapse, and interact with nested items.

## Usage

---

The **Tree View** component is used to navigate or manage hierarchical datasets, for representing file systems, nested categories, any structured dataset that benefits from a collapsible interface.

Common use cases include:

-   Directory structures
-   Nested navigation menus
-   Category selectors
-   Configurations and settings with nested options?

### Dos & Don'ts

| ✅ Do |
| --- |
| - Use a Tree View for hierarchical data where relationships between items are important |

| ❌ Don't |
| --- |
| - Don’t use a Tree View if there are no nodes or if the content is too minimal to justify a hierarchical structure |

### Best Practices in Context

1.  **Tree View**
2.  **Node/item**
3.  **Checkbox (multi-selection)**
4.  **Node/item name**

## Behavior

---

### Expand / Collapse

-   Items/Nodes can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide their children
-   The Tree View can be rendered with all nodes expanded by default
-   Individual nodes can be configured to start in an expanded state when the Tree View is rendered

### Selection

#### Single Selection

-   Clicking a node selects it and deselects any previously selected node

#### Checkbox tree/multi-selection

-   Each node/item has a checkbox for selection
-   Parent checkbox can represent:
    -   Checked: all children are selected
    -   Unchecked: no children are selected
    -   Indeterminate: partial selection of children
-   Selecting a parent node/item selects or deselects all children recursively

### Disabling

Disabled nodes cannot be selected, expanded, collapsed, or interact with. They are still display in the hierarchy for context.

## Navigation

---

### Focus Management

Only one node in the Tree View is focusable at a time.

Focus remains on a single visible node and moves predictably with keyboard navigation.

If a node contains interactive elements (e.g., a checkbox or link), those elements can receive focus.

### General Keyboard Shortcuts

Pressing Arrow Up / Arrow Down moves focus to the previous or next visible node.

Pressing Arrow Right:

-   If the focused node is collapsed, expands it
-   If the focused node is expanded, moves focus to its first child

Pressing Arrow Left:

-   If the focused node is expanded, collapses it
-   If the focused node is collapsed, moves focus to its parent

Pressing Home, or fn + Arrow Left, moves focus to the first visible node.

Pressing End, or fn + Arrow Right moves focus to the last visible node.

Pressing Enter or Space activates, expands, or collapses the focused node. If the node has a checkbox, it toggles its state.

Pressing Enter or Space + Shift + Arrow Up / Arrow Down selects a continuous range of nodes (multi-selection mode).

Pressing Enter or Space + Ctrl or Cmd toggles selection of individual node.

Pressing Ctrl or Cmd + A selects all nodes in the tree. When all nodes are already selected, it unselects all nodes.

Typing an alphanumeric character (`A-Z`, `a-z`) changes focus to the next node starting with that character.

## Accessibility

---

This component complies with the [Tree View WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/)
