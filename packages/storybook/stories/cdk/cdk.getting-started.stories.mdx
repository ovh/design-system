# OVHcloud Component Development Kit

This package contains all the agnostic framework utilities in order to make UI component easier.
This library will contain a lot of helpers that are all the same for each component library:

- overlay system to make select, menu, tooltip, ...
- stepper helpers to declare and validate steps for a stepper component
- scrolling strategies with a limited viewport
- clipboard management
- drag and drop helpers
- ...

For now, it contains the overlay positioning system and allows you to create select,
tooltips, menu and any component displaying dynamically its content in an overlay, a floating panel on trigger.

Documentation on the [Overlay](?path=/story/libraries-cdk-overlay-introduction--page) system.
