_An **Accordion** is a vertical header that reveals or hides an associated section of content._

<Canvas of={ AccordionStories.Overview } sourceState='none' />

## Overview

<div className="documentation-overview">
  <div>
    The **Accordion** component **delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure**.

    The header part gives the user a high-level overview of the content allowing them to decide which sections to
    read.

    **Accordions** can make **information processing and discovering more effective**. However, it does hide content
    from the users, and it’s important to account for a user not noticing or reading all the included content. If a user
    is likely to read all the content then then the usage of an **Accordion** would not be recommended as it adds an extra
    interaction to access the content; instead use a full scrolling page with normal headers.

## Anatomy

![Component anatomy](components/accordion/anatomy.png "Component anatomy")
  1. **Header**: contains the section title and acts as a control for revealing the panel or not (always visible).
  2. **Icon**: A "down/up" chevron [**Icon**](?path=/docs/ods-components-icon--documentation) is used to indicate the “expand/collapse” action, though the entire header area is clickable (always visible).
  3. **Panel**: the section of content associated with an **Accordion** header.

## Usage

Use any number of elements to visually display them as a group.
Several collapsible panels can co-exist in a same interface.

Use this component for :
* Organizing related information
* Shortening pages and reducing scrolling when content is not crucial to read in full
* When space is at a premium and long content cannot be displayed all at once, like on a mobile interface or in a side panel

## Placement

The **Accordion** component is adjusted to the parent's width. It can vary based on the content, layout, and page design.

By default, the **Accordion** content is left-aligned in its container, as the header does.

It can be placed within main page content or inside a side container (as panels, or tiles).

## Behavior

**Accordion** has two states : **collapsed** and **expanded**.

**Accordion is by default collapsed.**

When triggering the header part, the panel part should react as expanding or collapsing, depending on what previous
state it had.

The mouse cursor acts as a clickable area on the Header part of the component.

The **Icon** helps the user to know if the **Accordion** is collapsed or expanded :
  * Collapsed : chevron points down
  * Expanded : chevron points up

**The Header part of this component acts like a Button**, with hover, focus and active styles.

Same behavior and styling applies to both Desktop and Mobile modes.

## Variation

N/A

## Accessibility

The header part can be navigated through tabulation, with the same behavior as a [**Button**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation).

When focusing the header part, pressing `Enter` or `Space` keys will trigger its expansion or its collapsion.

For screen readers, the user can know easily that the **Accordion** is opened or not, and therefore the inner content is readable or not.
