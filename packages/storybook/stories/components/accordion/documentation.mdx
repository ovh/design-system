_An **Accordion** is a vertical header that reveals or hides an associated section of content._

  The **Accordion** component **delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure**.

  The header part gives the user a high-level overview of the content allowing them to decide which sections to
  read.

  **Accordions** can make **information processing and discovering more effective**. However, it does hide content
  from the users, and it’s important to account for a user not noticing or reading all the included content. If a user
  is likely to read all the content then then the usage of an **Accordion** would not be recommended as it adds an extra
  interaction to access the content; instead use a full scrolling page with normal headers.

1. **Header**: contains the section title and acts as a control for revealing the panel or not (always visible).
2. **Icon**: A "down/up" chevron <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Icon" label="Icon" story="Documentation" /> is used to indicate the “expand/collapse” action, though the entire header area is clickable (always visible).
3. **Panel**: the section of content associated with an **Accordion** header.

<Heading label="Usage" level={ 2 } />

Use any number of elements to visually display them as a group.
Several collapsible panels can co-exist in a same interface.

Use this component for :
* Organizing related information
* Shortening pages and reducing scrolling when content is not crucial to read in full
* When space is at a premium and long content cannot be displayed all at once, like on a mobile interface or in a side panel

<BestPractices
  donts={[
    '- Expose a lot of content in the Header section (i.e. more than 2 lines)',
    '- Use Accordions with essential content for users',
    <span>- Use <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Icon" label="Icon" story="Documentation" /> in header text</span>,
    '- Expose a lot of content in the Panel section (i.e. more than the viewport height)',
    '- Empty the Panel section, as the Accordion become useless',
    '- Disable Accordions, as it can be confusing for users',
    '- Trigger expanding/collapsing on hover action',
    '- Avoid nested Accordions, like collapsible content within collapsible content'
    ]}
  dos={[
    <span>- Header <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Text" label="Text" story="Documentation" /> describes the content contained in the panel. Use a clear and concise <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Text" label="Text" story="Documentation" />, and be explicit about the action that will happen if the option is selected</span>,
    <span>- Use sentence-style capitalization in header <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Text" label="Text" story="Documentation" /> (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized), no more than three words, and no punctuation</span>,
    <span>- Use Accordion instead of <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Tabs" label="Tab" story="Documentation" /> if users need to see multiple sections at once</span>,

<Heading label="Placement" level={ 2 } />

The **Accordion** component is adjusted to the parent's width. It can vary based on the content, layout, and page design.

By default, the **Accordion** content is left-aligned in its container, as the header does.

It can be placed within main page content or inside a side container (as panels, or tiles).

<Heading label="Behavior" level={ 2 } />

**Accordion** has two states : **collapsed** and **expanded**.

**Accordion is by default collapsed.**

When triggering the header part, the panel part should react as expanding or collapsing, depending on what previous
state it had.

The mouse cursor acts as a clickable area on the Header part of the component.

The **Icon** helps the user to know if the **Accordion** is collapsed or expanded :
  * Collapsed : chevron points down
  * Expanded : chevron points up

**The Header part of this component acts like a Button**, with hover, focus and active styles.

Same behavior and styling applies to both Desktop and Mobile modes.

<Heading label="Variation" level={ 2 } />

N/A

<Heading label="Accessibility" level={ 2 } />

The header part can be navigated through tabulation, with the same behavior as a <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Button" label="Button" story="Documentation" />.

When focusing the header part, pressing `Enter` or `Space` keys will trigger its expansion or its collapse.

For screen readers, the user can know easily that the **Accordion** is opened or not, and therefore the inner content is readable or not.
