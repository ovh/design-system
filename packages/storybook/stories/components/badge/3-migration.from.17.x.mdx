# Badge - migrate from v17 to v18
----

## Usage changes

Previous to v18, Badge component was actually a Chip component with specific properties set.

Chip has been split into two new components (Tag and Badge):
- use Tag when you need an interactive Chip that can be removed.
- use Badge when you need a presentational Chip.

On Chip component, slots were used to allow any content to be put inside the chip.

The new badge design enforces the usage of only text as the main content, with an optional icon on the left side.

Therefore, slots have been replaced by two attributes: `label` and `icon`.

```html
<osds-chip>
  <osds-icon name="star"></osds-icon>
  My badge
</osds-chip>
```

The same result would now be achieved using:
```html
<ods-badge icon="star"
           label="My badge">
</ods-badge>
```
