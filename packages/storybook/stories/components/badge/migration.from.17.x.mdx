<Heading label="Badge - migrate from v17 to v18" level={ 1 } />

<Heading label="Usage changes" level={ 2 } />

Previous to v18, Badge component was actually a Chip component with specific properties set.

Chip has been split into two new components (Tag and Badge):
- use Tag when you need an interactive Chip that can be removed.
- use Badge when you need a presentational Chip.

On Chip component, slots were used to allow any content to be put inside the chip.

The new badge design enforces the usage of only text as the main content, with an optional icon on the left side.

Therefore, slots have been replaced by two attributes: `label` and `icon`.

<Source code={`
<osds-chip>
  <osds-icon name="star"></osds-icon>
  My badge
</osds-chip>
`}
        dark="true"
        language="html" />

The same result would now be achieved using:

<Source code={`
<ods-badge icon="star"
           label="My badge">
</ods-badge>
`}
        dark="true"
        language="html" />

<Heading label="Attributes changes" level={ 2 } />

`contrasted` <OdsBadge color="critical" label="Removed" size="sm" />

Has been removed.

You can use the style customization to achieve the same result, until a new color get validated by the design team.

`color` <OdsBadge color="information" label="Updated" size="sm" />

Has been updated.

`default` is now `neutral`, `info` is now `information`, `error` is now `critical`.

New variants `alpha`, `beta`, `new` and `promotion` were added.

`disabled` <OdsBadge color="critical" label="Removed" size="sm" />

Has been removed.

`icon` <OdsBadge color="success" label="New" size="sm" />

New attribute (optional).

`inline` <OdsBadge color="critical" label="Removed" size="sm" />
