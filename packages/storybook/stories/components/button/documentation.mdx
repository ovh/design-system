  **Buttons** are triggerable elements that are used to set actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and
  allow them to interact with pages.

  **Button** labels express explicitly what action will occur when the user interacts with it. Its aspect describes
  the importance and influence level.

  This component exists in many ways : variants, sizes and colors.

<Heading label="Usage" level={ 2 } />

**Buttons** are mainly used for actions, like adding, removing, validating, etc.
They are used to allow users to interact with the page or its content.

**Buttons** work with other elements on a screen to **surface the most important actions the user wants to take in that context**.
**They must respect the proximity law** in order to guide the user on the action to be performed and the expected result.
A **Button** label indicates what happens when the user taps the **Button**, even if it's just to acknowledge something.

**Buttons** don't usually redirect to an external page. For that, see <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Link" label="Link" story="Documentation" />.

<BestPractices
  donts={[
    <span>- Use Buttons as <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Link" label="Link" story="Documentation" /> (using the ghost variant), prefer using the <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Link" label="Link" story="Documentation" /> component</span>,
    '- Put two identical Buttons side by side',
    '- Use success/error variants for other needs than validation/cancel',
  ]}
  dos={[
    '- Group a main with a secondary Button for page actions',
    '- At least one primary Button must be present per page in order to present the main action',
  ]}
/>

<Heading label="Placement" level={ 2 } />

The **Button** component has an automatic width regarding its context.

By default, the **Button** content is centered in its container.

<Heading label="Behavior" level={ 2 } />

A **Button** can be hovered, focused, clicked and disabled.

When in disabled state, it is impossible to focus or click on it. A "disabled" cursor is shown when hovering the disabled component.

An <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Icon" label="Icon" story="Documentation" /> can be displayed on the left or right of the **Button** label content.

<Heading label="Variation" level={ 2 } />

<Heading label="Color" level={ 3 } />

- **Primary** _(default)_: used for main usage of **Buttons**, and linked to the brand graphical charter.
- **Critical**: alerts users to high-priority actions or warnings that require immediate attention.

<Heading label="Variant" level={ 3 } />

- **Default**: primary actions, featuring a full background with a matching border to signify important emphasis.
- **Outline**: secondary actions, featuring a transparent background with a visible border to signify less emphasis than primary buttons.
- **Ghost**: tertiary or less prominent actions, blending into the background with minimal styling until hovered or focused to reduce visual dominance.

<Heading label="Size" level={ 3 } />

- **Small**: actions in compact spaces or within densely packed interfaces, providing a more subtle and space-efficient option.
- **Medium** _(default)_: main usage of **Buttons**, when they can be displayed in an important manner.

<Heading label="Accessibility" level={ 2 } />

When focusing the **Button**, pressing `Enter` or `Space` keys will trigger it.
