## Overview

<div className="documentation-overview">
  <div>
    **Buttons** are triggerable elements that are used to set actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and
    allow them to interact with pages.

    **Button** labels express explicitly what action will occur when the user interacts with it. Its aspect describes
    the importance and influence level.

    This component exists in many ways : variants, sizes and colors.

## Anatomy

![Component anatomy](components/button/anatomy.png "Component anatomy")

## Usage

**Buttons** are mainly used for actions, like adding, removing, validating, etc.
They are used to allow users to interact with the page or its content.

**Buttons** work with other elements on a screen to **surface the most important actions the user wants to take in that context**.
**They must respect the proximity law** in order to guide the user on the action to be performed and the expected result.
A **Button** label indicates what happens when the user taps the **Button**, even if it's just to acknowledge something.

**Buttons** don't usually redirect to an external page. For that, see [**Link**](?path=/docs/ods-components-link--documentation).

## Placement
The **Button** component has an automatic width regarding its context.

By default, the **Button** content is centered in its container.

## Behavior

A **Button** can be hovered, focused, clicked and disabled.

When in disabled state, it is impossible to focus or click on it. A "disabled" cursor is shown when hovering the disabled component.

## Variation

### Color

- **Primary** _(default)_: used for main usage of **Buttons**, and linked to the brand graphical charter.
- **Critical**: alerts users to high-priority actions or warnings that require immediate attention.

### Variant

- **Default**: primary actions, featuring a full background with a matching border to signify important emphasis.
- **Outline**: secondary actions, featuring a transparent background with a visible border to signify less emphasis than primary buttons.
- **Ghost**: tertiary or less prominent actions, blending into the background with minimal styling until hovered or focused to reduce visual dominance.

### Size

- **Small**: actions in compact spaces or within densely packed interfaces, providing a more subtle and space-efficient option.
- **Medium** _(default)_: main usage of **Buttons**, when they can be displayed in an important manner.

## Accessibility

When focusing the **Button**, pressing `Enter` or `Space` keys will trigger it.
