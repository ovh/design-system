# Button - migrate from v17 to v18
----

## Usage changes

The button can now only render an actual `button`, not a link.

If you need to redirect on click on a button, you can either:
- handle the redirection on the click handler
- wrap the button with your custom Link element


The button usage has changed a bit regarding content declaration.

Previously, slots were used to allow any content to be put inside the button.

The new design enforces the usage of only text as the main content, with an optional icon on the left side.

Therefore, slots have been replaced by two attributes: `label` and `icon`.

```html
<osds-button>
  <span slot="start">
    <osds-icon name="close" contrasted></osds-icon>
  </span>
  My button
</osds-button>
```

The same result would now be achieved using:
```html
<ods-button icon="xmark"
            label="My button">
</ods-button>
```

## Attributes changes

`circle` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

Has been removed.

This design is no longer part of the design system specification.

If you need to render such button, please contact the design team.

`contrasted` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

Has been removed.

You can use the style customization to achieve the same result, until a new color get validated by the design team.

`disabled` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/updated-00FFFF" />

Has been updated.

You can use the new `isDisabled` attribute to obtain the same behavior.

We did move from the usual `disabled` attribute for two reasons:
- to ensure consistency of boolean attribute naming across all components
- to ensure native behavior on disabled button, `disabled` is a native attribute that allows browsers to automatically
prevent some behavior (like click events, focus, ...). As we add custom feature that may enforce disabling the element,
like `isLoading`, we encounter conflicts between the web component attribute and the native one. Enforcing native
behavior is our main priority, so it is safer to separate our own attribute into a different one.

`download` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

`href` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

`rel` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

`target` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

Have been removed.

They're now irrelevant as the button cannot be rendered as a link anymore.

`icon` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/new-008000" />

New attribute (optional).

Allow you to render an icon on the left side of the button.

`isDisabled` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/new-008000" />

New attribute (optional).

Allow to you to make the button disabled.

`isLoading` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/new-008000" />

New attribute (optional).

Allow you to render a spinner and make the button disabled, useful on asynchronous action to prevent multiple clicks.

`label` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/new-008000" />

New attribute (required).

The label you want to render in the button.

`textAlign` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

Has been removed.

You can use the style customization to achieve the same result.
