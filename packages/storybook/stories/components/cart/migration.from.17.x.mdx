Cart has been removed from ODS components. <OdsBadge color="critical" label="Removed" size="sm" />

This component was too specific to a custom need and comes with quite a lot of downsides.

<Heading label="Performance & Complexity" level={ 3 } />

The whole component was composed of 9 web-components, each with their own rendering lifecycle.

Each of those were relying on DOM queries to update their states accordingly to their parents/siblings, which
can become quite problematic performance-wise.

Also, in order to use this component, the integrators had to learn about the 9 different interfaces and all their possible combinations.

<Heading label="Internal logic" level={ 3 } />

ODS components tend to be presentational, thus the internal logic should be handled by the integrators.

The current implementation of Cart was trying to enforce some of the logic (e.g. quantity computation).

This component is basically a very simple top-to-bottom layout, where each section can be rendered using `ods-text` or even
a simple text element. You can also use `ods-divider` to add some separation if needed.

All the colors and style properties can be found in the exposed design tokens.
