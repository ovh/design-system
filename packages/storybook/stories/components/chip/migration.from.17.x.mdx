# Chip - migrate from v17 to v18
----

Chip has been removed from ODS components. <ods-badge size="sm" color="critical" label="Removed"></ods-badge>

It has been split into two different components.

If you need a presentational component, with no behaviour, use [ods-badge](?path=/docs/ods-components-badge--documentation).

If you need a clickable element, use [ods-tag](?path=/docs/ods-components-tag--documentation).
