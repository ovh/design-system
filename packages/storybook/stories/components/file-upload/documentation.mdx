# Overview

File-upload allow users to select one or more files to upload to a specific location:

<Canvas of={ FileUploadStories.Overview } sourceState='none' />

<DocNavigator of={ FileUploadStories } linkId={ LINK_ID.FILE_UPLOAD } />

<Markdown>{ SpecificationsFileUpload }</Markdown>

# How to use?

The component does not handle any actual upload, nor it knows the status of each file (regarding progress or error),
as the upload process is different for every integration.

All the files you'll receive from this component are typed as `OdsFile`.

This is an extend of the native `File` interface with optional attribute that you can set to alter the display:
- `error`: set this if the upload of the file fail, to display an error message near it on the component file list.
- `isUploaded`: set this on file upload success, to display a success message  near it on the component file list.
- `odsId`: a generated unique id to help you identify the current file being manipulated, you can of course ignore it and use your own `id` attribute directly.
- `progress`: update this during the upload to display a progress-bar with current file upload progress.

## Adding files

When a file is selected/dropped and pass the validation (if either accept or max-file are set), you'll receive an
`odsFileChange` event containing an Array of OdsFile.

The event will contain:
- the array of added OdsFile
- an `noError` boolean indicating if there was any type or max file rejection. It can be useful to manage the global error state
as rejection may occurs at the same time as actual change (ex: `max-file="2"` and you drop 3 files, 2 get accepted and one get rejected)

This is the right place to:
- initiate the upload call
- init files progress to 0
- set up your request progress/end/error listeners

To update the component list, set the files attributes with the new full list of files, ex:
```js
myFileUpload.files = (myFileUpload.files || []).concat(event.detail.files);
```

## Removing file

When a file is removed/cancelled, you'll receive an `odsFileCancel` event containing the relevant OdsFile.

If the file is not yet uploaded, this is the right place to abort your upload request (using native `AbortSignal` or specific external library feature).

You can then update the component list with the new full list of files, ex:
```js
myFileUpload.files = myFileUpload.files.filter((file) => file.odsId !== detail.odsId);
```

## Managing errors

There are two different kind of errors that you may want to display, global error and per-file error.

To display an error specific to a file, you should handle it directly in your request error handler by setting the `error` attribute on the file.

For global error, you should listen to the `odsFileRejected` event.

This event is triggered:
- if a file is dropped that doesn't match the accept pattern (if `accept` set)
- if the max file limit is reached (if `max-file` is set)

The event will contain:
- an array of rejected files
- the reason of the rejection, either file type or max file

You can then set the `error` attribute of your `ods-file-upload` accordingly.

# Style customization

You can add your own style on the file-upload element using the parts:
- `dropzone` to customize the top dropzone part
- `file-list` to customize the bottom file list part

Custom file-upload css:

<Canvas of={ FileUploadStories.CustomCSS } sourceState='shown'/>

# Examples

## Default

<Canvas of={ FileUploadStories.Default } sourceState='shown' />

## Disabled

<Canvas of={ FileUploadStories.Disabled } sourceState='shown' />

## Custom labels

<Canvas of={ FileUploadStories.CustomLabels } sourceState='shown' />

## Accept only specific file type

To limit the file types that can be uploaded, you can use the `accept` attribute.

It works exactly the same as the one from the native [input file](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept).

<Canvas of={ FileUploadStories.Accept } sourceState='shown' />

## Limit the maximum number of file

<Canvas of={ FileUploadStories.MaxFile } sourceState='shown' />

## Send to server and display progress

<Canvas of={ FileUploadStories.Progress } sourceState='shown' />
