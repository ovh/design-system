<Heading label="Flag - migrate from v17 to v18" level={ 1 } />

Flag has been removed from ODS components. <OdsBadge color="critical" label="Removed" size="sm" />

Using ODS Flag, pre V18, does require every project to setup a specific build configuration to be able to fetch the assets.

This whole config should not be enforced by ODS and should be managed by each the way they prefer.

<Heading label="The assets issue" level={ 2 } />

Due to how Stencil works, there is no way to lazy load specific assets on demand.

Possible solutions are:
- inlining the assets in the final bundle
- externalize the assets to a remote source
- setup the assets path on each project using the web-component

<Heading label="Inlining assets" level={ 3 } />

This solution will transform the assets into base64 strings and embed them in the final web-component bundle.

It is fine when dealing with small assets (like the spinner svg).

However, flags are usually high-quality svg files that will add weight to the bundle, thus it is not a viable solution.

<Heading label="Externalize the assets" level={ 3 } />

Putting all the flags svg to a remote dedicated server/cdn and embed only the url would be, by far, the most
performant solution.

Regrettably, this is not possible yet due to internal security rules.

We do hope a solution will be found at some point, that will allow us to put back this component.

<Heading label="Setup the assets path manually" level={ 3 } />

This is the current solution that projects using ODS pre-v18 need to setup.

How it works:
- ODS brings a dependency to a flag library (`flag-icons`) that ends up in the app `node_modules`
- The project that wants to use flag, updates its dev server and bundler config to copy the flags from the
`node_modules` to its own assets directory on build
- The Flag component can now be used with the `asset-path` prop set to the previously setup assets path

> Using ODS Flag enforces the use of a specific flag lib on a given version

Which is not specially a good things, project can decide to use wherever flag lib they prefer, though we may recommend
`flag-icons`.

> Using ODS Flag provides the basic style of a flag item

This same style can be applied on your own flag element using the `ods-flag` mixin available in v18 (see using ODS mixins).

<Heading label="How to use Flag in v18" level={ 2 } />

- add the flag assets you want to use on your project (either using a dependency to a lib like `flag-icon`, or adding custom assets directly).
- keep your previous setup untouched.
- replace the `osds-flag` with an `img` element with your asset path and apply the `ods-flag` mixin to it.
