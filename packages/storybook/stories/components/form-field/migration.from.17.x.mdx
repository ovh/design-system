# FormField - migrate from v17 to v18
----

## Attributes changes

`inline ` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

Has been removed.

Form Field is now `inline-flex` by default. You can add some style directly on the component if you want to override that.

## Migration examples

Inline Form Field:
```html
<osds-form-field inline></osds-form-field>

<!-- is now -->

<ods-form-field></ods-form-field>
```
