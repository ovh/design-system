You can use the new `alt` attribute to obtain the same behavior.

`color` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

Icons are now font, they will by default have the same color as the current text. (TODO will be true after font update only)

You can override this using a css class on the component directly.
