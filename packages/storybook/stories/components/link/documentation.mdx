1. **Link text**: Communicates what is being linked to.
2. <StorybookLink kind={ ODS_COMPONENTS_TITLE.icon } story={ STORY.documentation }>Icon</StorybookLink> (optional): Indicates the destination or type of content being.

<Heading label="Usage" level={ 2 } />

**Links** are used as navigational elements.

They are also used when linking to another document. In that case, **Link** description should contain type and size of document.

<Heading label="When to use a link or a button?" level={ 3 } />

Links and buttons serve different purposes, and using them correctly improves both accessibility and user experience.

* Use a link when the action navigates the user to another page or resource, either within your application or to an external site
* Use a button when the action performs a function or triggers a behavior on the current page, like submitting a form, opening a modal, or toggling a menu.

A button should not mimic a link. It can lead to confusion for users and assistive technologies, as buttons are not typically expected to handle navigation.

<BestPractices
  donts={[
    '- Don\'t use a link to perform actions like "save", "submit", or "cancel", use a button for that',
    '- Don\'t use vague text like "Click here" or "Read more", it provides no context for screen readers or SEO',
    '- Don\'t write entire sentences as link label',
    '- Don\'t apply different colors to a link and its adjacent icon. They should appear as one cohesive element',
    '- Don\'t open a link in a new tab or window unless it\'s clearly indicated and necessary (e.g., for external sites)',
    '- Don\'t forget to set appropriate rel attributes (e.g., rel="noopener noreferrer") for external links opened in new tabs',
  ]}
  dos={[
    '- Use a link to navigate to another page, section, or external website, not to trigger actions',
    '- Make link labels clear and descriptive, so users understand where the link will take them',
    '- Keep link labels short ideally 1â€“4 words',
    '- Indicate when a link leads to a document or file by including its type and size (e.g., "Annual Report (PDF, 1.2MB)")',
    '- Optionally include an icon, but ensure it\'s styled consistently with the link label',

<Heading label="Placement" level={ 2 } />

A **Link** can stand alone on a page, or it can be placed within a sentence or a paragraph.

<Heading label="Behavior" level={ 2 } />

**Link** component can be hovered, focused, clicked and disabled.

When disabled, users cannot focus nor click on the **Link**.

On hover, **Link** is underlined and its color changes.

An optional icon can be displayed on the left or right of the **Link** label content. Icon-only **Link** also exists but it must meet accessibility requirements. See Accessibility section below.

When users clicks anywhere on the **Link**, even its optional icon, they are redirected to the expected page or section.

<Heading label="Navigation" level={ 2 } />

<Heading label="Focus Management" level={ 3 } />

The **Link** component can receive keyboard focus and is part of the standard tab order.

<Heading label="General Keyboard Shortcuts" level={ 3 } />

Pressing `Enter` while a **Link** is focused activates it, navigating to the associated destination.

Pressing `Shift` + `Tab` moves focus to the previous interactive element.

If a **Link** opens in a new tab, focus remains on the original page unless otherwise specified.
