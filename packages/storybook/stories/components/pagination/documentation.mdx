## Overview

<div className="documentation-overview">
  <div>
    The **Pagination** component is used to divide content into discrete pages and provide navigation controls to move between them.

    This component enhances usability by allowing users to browse through large sets of data without overwhelming the interface.

    **Pagination** can include various controls like next/previous buttons and page numbers.

| - When using Pagination, please display preferably ~25 items of the related set on each page                                                                                                         |

| - Use Pagination component for less than 2 pages to handle                                                                                           |
| - For an unpredicted number of pages, prefer the use of infinite scrolling rather than a Pagination                                                                                           |

## Placement

**Pagination** is presented to the user near the container it uses for pagination; it can be located just above or below it.

Usually, the **Pagination** is end-aligned horizontally, as its usage is not principal to the container.

## Behavior

### Amount of items per page

The number of items displayed in **Pagination** is depending on its referential.

However, there are few rules to be applied to display it correctly.

Number of items in the component can be chunked in packs of :
- 10
- 25
- 50
- 100
- 300

This value is conditioning the number of items that will be displayed per page.

By default, 10 items per page are displayed, but it can be set to match your need.

### Amount of pages

A maximum of 6 numbered page [**Buttons**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) can be visible at once, with a minimum of 1.

Arrow Buttons are always visible, no matter what the amount of pages.

Depending on the current page number and the amount of pages, here are the different displays of the whole component:
- If amount of pages is less than 7, all numbered page [**Buttons**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) can be visible at once
- If amount of pages is 7 or more :
  - If current page is the 4th one or less, the first 5 numbered [**Buttons**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) are present, then an ellipsis and the last numbered [**Button**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) corresponding of the amount of pages
  - If current page is the 4th to last or more, the first page [**Button**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) is displayed followed by an ellipsis and the last 5 numbered [**Buttons**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation)
  - If current page is between the previous bounds are displayed, in order :
    - the first page [**Button**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation),
    - an ellipsis,
    - 3 numbered [**Buttons**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation), corresponding to : previous-to-current / current / next-to-current page,
    - an ellipsis,
    - the last numbered [**Button**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation)

### Navigation

Current page [**Button**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) has a selected styling, yet it is a not clickable.

If the selected page number is the first page, the previous page arrow [**Button**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) is disabled; same thing applies with the last page as selected and the next page arrow [**Button**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) disabled.

An event is triggered when the current page changes in the Pagination, as well as the items per page changes.

## Variation

N/A

## Accessibility

All [**Buttons**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) are accessible via tabulation controls.

Previous and next page arrow [**Buttons**](?path=/docs/ods-components-button--documentation) are labelled as their explicit usage.
