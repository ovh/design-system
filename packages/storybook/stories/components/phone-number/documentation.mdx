![Component anatomy](components/phone-number/anatomy.png "Component anatomy")

1. **Country indicator Select**: displays the selected country flag and the list of countries by click. List is scroll-able, with 5 items visible at the same time. Each country name is written in users locale, in alphabetical order (for Latin script) _(optional)_
2. **Input field**: displays the country indicator as prefix when users select a country, and they can enter their phone number in this field (from 7 to 12 characters maximum). The <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Input" label="Input" story="Documentation" /> field also has a placeholder to provide hints regarding format according to the selected country.

<Heading label="Usage" level={ 2 } />

**Phone Number** component should be used when there is a need to collect the user's phone number, in a form for instance:
- As <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Form Field" label="Form Field" story="Documentation" /> in an user profile
- As in contact/appointment form
- For telecom configuration

<Heading label="Dos & Don'ts" level={ 3 } />

<BestPractices
  donts={[
    '- Force a strict format to users',
    <span>- Make a Phone Number <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Input" label="Input" story="Documentation" /> as required without explaining to users why this field is required</span>,
    '- Assume exclusive use of mobile phone numbers',
  ]}
  dos={[
    '- Validate Phone number format when user leaves the field',
    <span>- Use Phone Number without the optional country indicator <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Select" label="Select" story="Documentation" /> when you only accept user's locale as selection</span>,
    '- Use a helper when validation is in error state (expected number of characters, expected format...)',
  ]}
/>

<Heading label="Placement" level={ 2 } />

**Phone Number** is a group of <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Select" label="Select" story="Documentation" /> and <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Input" label="Input" story="Documentation" />, and should act as their specific placements.

<Heading label="Behavior" level={ 2 } />

When the user selects a country, it determines the format used to validate their phone number. If selected country has been modified, expected format and placeholder will be updated.

If the field content is in error state (i.e. missing or wrong characters), the whole **Phone Number** component becomes in error state.

An event is triggered when the <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Input" label="Input" story="Documentation" /> value changes.

<Heading label="Locale" level={ 3 } />

The locale (i.e. country list translation in <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Select" label="Select" story="Documentation" />) is first set to the value provided as a property.

If the given property is not defined or recognized, the component attempts to use the browser's locale settings.

If the browser's locale is also not recognized, the component defaults to English (EN).

<Heading label="ISO code" level={ 3 } />

The ISO code is initially set to the value provided as a property.

If the given property is not defined or recognized, the component attempts to determine the ISO code based on the browser's locale.

If the browser's locale is not recognized, the component defaults to the first ISO code in the predefined country list.

Keyboard navigation is the same as <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Select" label="Select" story="Documentation" /> and <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Form elements/Input" label="Input" story="Documentation" /> does, `Tab` key allows to focus to one another.
