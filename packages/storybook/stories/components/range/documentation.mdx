_**Range** component is used to allow users to visually select one or more values from a range of values by moving the handle along a bar_

## Overview

<div className="documentation-overview">
  <div>
    The **Range** component is used for selecting a numerical value or a range of values within a specified range.

    It provides a visual and interactive way to adjust values, often used in forms, settings, and data filtering.

    The component can support single-value sliders or dual-handle sliders for selecting ranges.

## Anatomy

![Component anatomy](components/range/anatomy.png "Component anatomy")

1. **Track**: the range of values the user can select and adjust
2. **Filled track**: the user's selected value within the **Range**. It is filled from the minimum value to the selected value
3. **Thumb**: a positional indicator. It can be moved along the track to indicate a position on this track
4. **Additional thumb**: a second positional indicator to get a dual **Range**. It allows users to select a portion within the range _(optional)_
5. **Minimum value label**: beginning of a **Range** as its minimum value
6. **Maximum value label**: end of a **Range** as its maximum value

## Usage

A **Range** is used to select a numeric value within a given range with defined minimum and maximum values.

It is easily adjustable in a visually pleasing interface and, after interacting with it, changes are reflected immediately.

A dual **Range** allows the user to select a numeric range value that is no less than a given value, and no more than another given value.

| - Include a label on a **Range**, such as the one provided by [**Form Field**](?path=/docs/ods-components-form-elements-form-field--documentation) component, to explain the purpose of the **Range** |
| - Add a default numeric value                                                                                                                                                                |

| - Use a **Range** in too small spaces on a page: it is necessary to have enough space in the UI                                                                                  |
| - Use a continuous **Range** when the defined range of values is too large: use a discrete **Range**                                                                             |

</Markdown>

## Placement

A **Range** can be used in a page as long as there is a need to allow users to select a numeric value within a given range, for a quantity or a volume for example.

It has a width by default, but it can widen to match its container.

The **Range** can also be used inside components.

It also can be combined with other elements such as an [**Input**](?path=/docs/ods-components-form-elements-input--documentation) for a better control of the value selection.

## Behavior

A **Range** can be focused and hovered. It also can be disabled.

The user can select a numeric value by clicking and dragging the thumb along the track.

An event is triggered when the **Range** value(s) changes.

## Variation

N/A

## Accessibility

Each **Range** thumb can be focused using `Tabulation`, using `Up` and `Right` arrows increases its value, `Down` and `Left` keys decreases it.
