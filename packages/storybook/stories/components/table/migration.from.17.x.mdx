# Table - migrate from v17 to v18
----

## Attributes changes

`variant ` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/updated-00FFFF" />

Has been updated.

A new `default` value has been added, it is the default value if no variant are set,
so you don't need to change anything from your current integration.
