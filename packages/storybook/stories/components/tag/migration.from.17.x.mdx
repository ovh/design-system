# Tag - migrate from v17 to v18
----

## Usage changes

Previous to v18, Tag component was actually a Chip component with specific properties set.

Chip has been split into two new components (Tag and Badge):
- use Tag when you need an interactive Chip that can be removed.
- use Badge when you need a presentational Chip.

On Chip component, slots were used to allow any content to be put inside the chip.

The new tag design enforces the usage of only text as the main content, with an optional icon on the left side.

Therefore, slots have been replaced by two attributes: `label` and `icon`.

```html
<osds-chip removable>
  <osds-icon name="star"></osds-icon>
  My tag
</osds-chip>
```

The same result would now be achieved using:
```html
<ods-tag icon="star"
         label="My tag">
</ods-tag>
```

## Attributes changes

`contrasted` <ods-badge size="sm" color="critical" label="Removed"></ods-badge>

Has been removed.

You can use the style customization to achieve the same result, until a new color get validated by the design team.

`disabled` <ods-badge size="sm" label="Updated"></ods-badge>

Has been updated.

You can use the new `isDisabled` attribute to obtain the same behavior.

`icon` <ods-badge size="sm" color="success" label="New"></ods-badge>

New attribute (optional).

Allow you to render an icon on the left side of the tag.

`inline` <ods-badge size="sm" color="critical" label="Removed"></ods-badge>

Has been removed.

Tags are inline by default. If you need to change this, you can use the style customization.

`label` <ods-badge size="sm" color="success" label="New"></ods-badge>

New attribute (required).

The label you want to render in the tag.

`removable` <ods-badge size="sm" color="critical" label="Removed"></ods-badge>

Has been removed.

Tag are all removable. If you want to display information without the removal, use the Badge component.

`selectable` <ods-badge size="sm" color="critical" label="Removed"></ods-badge>

Has been removed.

Tag are not meant to be selected.
You may eventually mimic previous behavior using some style customization,
but we'll advise to reach out the design team before doing so.
