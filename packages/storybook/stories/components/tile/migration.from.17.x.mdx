Tile has been removed from ODS components. <OdsBadge color="critical" label="Removed" size="sm" />

Basic usage of tile have been replaced by the <StorybookLink kind="ODS Components/Card" label="card" story="Documentation" /> component for now.

Until new designs and specifications gets validated, previous tile specificities will have to be implemented manually.
