# Tile - migrate from v17 to v18
----

Tile has been removed from ODS components. <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/removed-FF0000" />

Basic usage of tile have been replaced by the [card](?path=/docs/ods-components-card--documentation) component for now.

Until new designs and specifications gets validated, previous tile specificities will have to be implemented manually.
