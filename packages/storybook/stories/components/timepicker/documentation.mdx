## Anatomy

![Component anatomy](components/timepicker/anatomy.png "Component anatomy")

1. **Time Input**: it is a text field where users can type a time in expected format.
2. **Timezone Select**: a list of worldwide timezones available

## Usage

**Timepicker** is used to allow a selection of a specific time.

It is useful for scheduling such as planning a meeting.

A **Timepicker** field includes the hour, minutes and optionally seconds. It can be followed by an AM/PM indicator.

For some use case, an optional time zone [**Select**](?path=/docs/ods-components-form-elements-select--documentation) can be added to allow users to select their desired time zone from a list of options.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - Use a **Timepicker** in a form when you need to display scheduling options                                   |
| - Add label and/or helper to the **Timepicker** with [**Form Field**](?path=/docs/ods-components-form-elements-form-field--documentation) component                                   |
| - A **Timepicker** can be combined with a Date picker to allow users to pick both date and time                                   |
| - Use AM/PM selector when you plan to use 12 hours format                                   |
| - Display a restricted list of timezones that makes sense, especially when the company or product exists only in few countries. Otherwise it adds to confusion                                   |

| - Use a placeholder to provide crucial information since it will disappear after typing into the time field |

## Placement

A **Timepicker** can be used in a page as long as there is a need to allow users to pick a time.

The time field has a fixed width by default but, when used in a form, its width should match the other inputs.

**Timepicker** should be vertically aligned with other form components on a same page.

## Behavior

A **Timepicker** can widen to match its container (width of the elements is 50% each).

It has the same states and behaviors for each inner component (i.e. [**Input**](?path=/docs/ods-components-form-elements-input--documentation) and [**Select**](?path=/docs/ods-components-form-elements-select--documentation)).

## Variation

N/A

## Accessibility

Each **Timepicker** fields can be browsed through tabulations.
