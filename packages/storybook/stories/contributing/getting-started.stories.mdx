# Contributing

`ODS` is based on `open source` concept and all contributions are very appreciated.

When contributing to `ODS` project, to help us to make it even better, please first have a look to our guidelines and
rules we would like you to follow.
There are different ways to contribute such as creating a new component or a new iteration of an existing component,
reporting bugs, or sending suggestions.

## Prerequisites

You need a `nodeJS` and `yarn` as prerequisites.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) >= 18.17
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) >= 2.4

We recommend to be familiar with:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [StencilJs](https://stenciljs.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Installation

First, clone ODS repository:

```shell
ssh://git@github.com:ovh/design-system.git
```

Then, install dependencies (in the repository folder):

```shell
yarn
```

for `node_modules` retrieving and initialization of workspace structure.

Build all components and generate the needed technical specification documentation with:

```shell
yarn build:prod
yarn doc
```

You are now ready to dev ðŸŽ‰

## Storybook

All the technical documentation and demonstrations of components are integrated into Storybook.

In order to start it from your local environment, from the root folder, just type:
```shell
yarn storybook
```

Or open `packages/storybook` in terminal and type:
```shell
yarn start
```

â“˜ When you change files inside the storybook folders `packages/storybook` (`tsx` and `mdx` stories), the server
will live reload and updates the storybook

### Live updates

If you want to watch the code changes with the storybook started, you have to select the related prompt for watching
components/libraries:

```shell
yarn start
```

Then start storybook:

```shell
yarn storybook
```

â“˜ Selecting `all` in the `start` prompt can have heavy load for your computer.
We recommended to watch only one component or library.

## Development server

You can start a `dev server` for one component in order to make the development easier in a simple HTML page.
This is the first step to follow developing a component, before making the story of the storybook.
Go to the folder of the component you want to launch and start it with:

```shell
cd packages/stencil/components/button
yarn start
```

`index.html`: main page HTML page of the dev server

> â“˜ all components are developed with `StencilJs` today and are located into `packages/components/`

## Contributing a new component

Before any new component is published into OVHcloud Design System, the team of core contributors will review it
according to the following criteria:

* the component is usable and consistent
* it can be used in different contexts (i.e: responsive)
* it is accessible
* the component has been tested
* a documentation has been provided

## Reporting bugs or sending suggestions

If you spot an issue or you would like to send a suggestion,
please [search if a ticket about it already exists](https://github.com/ovh/design-system/issues). If a
related ticket does not exist, you can create an issue.

When you are reporting a bug, please select `Bug` as issue type and explain specific steps to reproduce (what is
happening and what you expect to see instead).

If you are requesting a new feature, or you'd like to send suggestions, please select `improvement` as issue type.
Please provide a detailed description of your request and any potential design when you create the ticket.

When you suggest a component or a new iteration for an existing component, please check that it fills the following
criteria:

* it is unique: it does not duplicate an existing component in the Design System
* it can be used by multiple services or products (re-usability)
