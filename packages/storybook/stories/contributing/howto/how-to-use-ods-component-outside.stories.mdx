## Import the component
You have to import the component you would like to use in your own component in `packages/components/<component>/src/global.ts`:
``` typescript
import '@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>';
```

## Exclude component for React and Vue

You also need to exclude the imported component for React and Vue in your own component in `packages/components/<component>/stencil.config.ts` as following:
``` typescript
excludeComponents: ['osds-<component>'],
```
