<Heading label="Frequently Asked Questions" level={ 1 } />

*Welcome to the F.A.Q. section of the OVHcloud Design System (ODS).*

*Here, we aim to address common questions and provide helpful guidance for developers.*

<Heading label="I can't find a component I need" level={ 2 } />

ODS provides base components that you can build on top of and implement in various contexts.

If you need a new component, we recommend working with the design team to request and design the component to ensure it aligns with the ODS guidelines.

<Heading label="Can I use another CSS framework on top of ODS?" level={ 2 } />

You can use any CSS framework on top of ODS.

Note that some imperative CSS frameworks like Bootstrap may override ODS styling.

Ensure compatibility by testing the integration in your project.

<Heading label="What about Web Components and Vue?" level={ 2 } />

Starting from v19, ODS have moved to fully React-based components.
Web Components and the Vue wrapper are now only available in v18.x, which is now in maintenance mode,
so there won't be any new features for this version.

If you still need to access documentation about Web Components or Vue, use the version selector at the top left to switch to the latest 18.x documentation, where you'll find the most up-to-date information.
