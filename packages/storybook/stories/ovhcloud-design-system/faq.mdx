# Frequently Asked Questions

*Welcome to the F.A.Q. section of the OVHcloud Design System (ODS).*

*Here, we aim to address common questions and provide helpful guidance for developers.*

## I can't find a component I need

ODS provides base components that you can build on top of and implement in various contexts.

If you need a new component, we recommend working with the design team to request and design the component to ensure it aligns with the ODS guidelines.

## How do I customize the style of my component?

To customize the style of your component, you can refer individually to the technical information of the component you wish to customize.

*Example here with the [Accordion component](?path=/docs/ods-components-accordion--technical-information#style-customization).*

It provides detailed instructions on how to apply custom styles effectively.

## [React] How can I test events with `react-testing-library`?

Custom events such as the ones from ODS can be tested in React with `fireEvent`.

For example, to test the `odsChange` event on `ods-input`:

```javascript
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { OdsInput } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components/react';

test('should handle odsChange event', () => {
  const handleChange = jest.fn();
  const { getByTestId } = render(<OdsInput onOdsChange={handleChange} data-testid="ods-input" />);

  fireEvent.change(getByTestId('ods-input'), { target: { value: 'new value' } });

  expect(handleChange).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

## Can I use another CSS framework on top of ODS?

ODS components are primarily native web components, allowing you to apply styling from different CSS frameworks.

Note that some imperative CSS frameworks like Bootstrap may override ODS styling.

Ensure compatibility by testing the integration in your project.

## How can I import ESModule / CommonJS packages?

For detailed instructions on importing ESModule or CommonJS packages, please refer to our [Get Started](?path=/docs/ovhcloud-design-system-get-started--docs) documentation.

## How can I import ODS CSS-only styling?

To import ODS CSS-only styling, please refer to our [Get Started](?path=/docs/ovhcloud-design-system-get-started--docs) documentation.

## [ODS >= v17.1.0 | Safari < v16.2] My form elements are not displayed?

If you are using a form component such as *OdsInput* on ODS version `>= 17.1.0`, you might encounter an issue with your component not being displayed on older versions of Safari (`< 16.2`).

This is primarily due to older versions of Safari not supporting `AttachInternals` which are essential for our components to connect form elements with forms.

We would therefore recommend using versions of Safari superior to `16.4`.
