## Overview
OVHcloud Design System is a collection of reusable components to create a consistent user experience across OVHcloud pages and products, acting as a single source of truth.

We provide agnostic components and their React, Vue wrapped versions.

All the OVHcloud Design System packages are available on [**NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## How to use ODS components in my project

### Installation
```sh
yarn add @ovhcloud/ods-components @ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans
```
or
```sh
npm install --save @ovhcloud/ods-components @ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans
```

You should add @ovhcloud/ods-common-core when you need to use Flag component. For more detail, see [Assets](#assets) section.
You should also add @ovhcloud/ods-common-theming when you would like to use a component with an intent.

### Import components

#### As native webcomponents

There are two different ways of using ODS webcomponent, using lazy-loading or bundle.

To use lazy-loading, just include in your project the loader script, it will take care of loading each component resources on-demand.

```typescript
import { defineCustomElements } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components/dist/loader';
defineCustomElements();
```

If you prefer to use each components directly, you can import them separately.
This is recommended when working on projects bundled (using webpack, rollup, ...) as it is more optimized for tree-shaking.

```typescript
import { defineCustomElement as defineButton } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components/dist/components/osds-button';
defineButton();
```

#### As React components

To use a React version of an ODS component, you need to import it from the `react` sub directory.

```typescript
import { OsdsButton, OsdsText } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components/react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <OsdsButton ...>
      <OsdsText>
        Some Button
      </OsdsText>
    </OsdsButton>
  );
};
```

Components are compatible with React v16.8+.

#### As Vue components

To use a Vue version of an ODS component, you need to import it from the `vue` sub directory.

```typescript
<template>
  <OsdsButton ...>
    <OsdsText>
      Some Button
    </OsdsText>
  </OsdsButton>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
import { OsdsButton, OsdsText } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components/vue';
import '@ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans';

export default defineComponent({
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    OsdsButton,
    OsdsText,
  },
});
</script>
```

Components are compatible with Vue 3.

### Import components constants

All enums, interfaces, events are available directly from the `ods-components` lib

```typescript
import type { OdsButtonAttribute } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components'
import { ODS_BUTTON_SIZE, ODS_BUTTON_SIZES } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components';
```

### Import the theme
You need to import a theme to display all the components correctly.
It defines all the colors, typographies, sizes etc.
The default theme is `blue-jeans` but you can build yours.

via HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" src="./node_modules/@ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans" />
```

via ES import:

```javascript
import '@ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans';
```

via css import:
```css
@import '~@ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans';
```

### Assets

#### Ods-flag
To use the flags in your application, you'll have to copy the flags svg where you need them in your application.

First, you have to setup ods by calling `odsSetup` in your application:

```typescript
import { odsSetup } from '@ovhcloud/ods-common-core';
odsSetup();
```

Then, you have to set the path that point to the directory where the flags are located:
```typescript
Ods.instance().assetPath(`path/`);
```
