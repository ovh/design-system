Presenting all changes, components per components will cause a very long and hard to use changelog.

Instead we'll present you the fundamental changes that have been applied for all of the existing components.

The same logics has been applied to each components.

If you have any issue finding a specific change, feel free to contact us directly and we'll help you migrate.

## All Components

### Dependency

To use the component add a dependency to either:

* `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>` to import only the specific component.
* `@ovhcloud/ods-components` to import all components.

### Import

Replace any imports like the followings:

```js
// Previously component were imported using one of:
import { OsdsSpinner } from '@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components/spinner'
import { OsdsSpinner } from '@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components/spinner/react'
import { OsdsSpinner } from '@ovhcloud/ods-stencil/components/spinner/vue'

// Enums were imported from the ods-core library
import { OdsSpinnerSize, OdsSpinnerSizeList } from '@ovhcloud/ods-core'

// Interfaces were imported from the ods-core library
import { OdsSpinnerAttributes } from '@ovhcloud/ods-core'
```

to:

```js
// Component are now imported using one of:
import { OsdsSpinner } from '@ovhcloud/ods-component-spinner'
import { OsdsSpinner } from '@ovhcloud/ods-component-spinner/react'
import { OsdsSpinner } from '@ovhcloud/ods-component-spinner/vue'

// Enums are now imported directly from the component
import { ODS_SPINNER_SIZE, ODS_SPINNER_SIZES } from '@ovhcloud/ods-component-spinner'

// Interfaces are now imported directly from the component
import type { OdsSpinnerAttribute } from '@ovhcloud/ods-component-spinner'
```

Some types have been removed from ODS, as they were empty or not used, if you can't find a type you were using,
please contact us to see where it has been moved or how to replace it.
