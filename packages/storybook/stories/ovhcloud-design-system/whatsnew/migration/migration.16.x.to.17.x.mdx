# [16.6.0](https://ovh.github.io/design-system/v16.6.0/?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-what-s-new-changelog--page) to [17.0.0](https://ovh.github.io/design-system/v17.0.0/?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-what-s-new-changelog--page) ([compare](https://github.com/ovh/design-system/compare/release/16.0...release/17.0))

Main focus on this version has been on simplifying ODS integration in existing projects (React, Vue, JS, ...).

If you have any issue finding a specific change, feel free to contact us directly and we'll help you migrate.

## All Components

### Dependency

We now only publish one `ods-components` library that embed all the ODS components.

You need to remove any component specific dependencies, ex:

```
"ods-component-button": "16.6.0" // should be removed
```

Instead use only one dependency:

```
"ods-components": "17.0.0"
```

### Import

You can see more details in the updated [Get Started documentation](?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-get-started--page#how-to-use-ods-components-in-my-project)

#### Native webcomponents

Using lazy-loading:

```js
import { defineCustomElements } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components/dist/loader';
defineCustomElements();
```

As module:

```js
import { defineCustomElement as defineButton } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components/dist/components/osds-button';
defineButton();
```

#### React components

```js
import { OsdsButton, OsdsText } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components/react';
```

#### Vue components

```js
import { OsdsButton, OsdsText } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components/vue';
```

#### Types and constans

All types and constants are accessible from the `ods-components` library:

```js
import type { OdsButtonAttribute } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components'
import { ODS_BUTTON_SIZE, ODS_BUTTON_SIZES } from '@ovhcloud/ods-components';
```

### About `ods-common-xxx` libs

We're trying to remove the need to add any `ods-common-xxx` lib to any project using ODS.

For now, you will still need to add `ods-common-theming` as a dependency to access the `ODS_THEME_COLOR_INTENT` values.

If you still ended up adding `ods-common-core` in your project, please give us the feedback so that we work on removing that need.
