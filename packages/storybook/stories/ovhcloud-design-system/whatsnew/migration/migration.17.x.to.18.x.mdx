# [17.2.2](https://ovh.github.io/design-system/v17.2.2/?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-what-s-new-changelog--page) to [18.0.0](https://ovh.github.io/design-system/v18.0.0/?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-what-s-new-changelog--page) ([compare](https://github.com/ovh/design-system/compare/release/17.0...release/18.0))

If you have any questions or issues regarding the new version, feel free to reach us directly.

<Heading label="Libraries" level={ 2 } />

The following libs have been removed:
- @ovhcloud/ods-cdk
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-core
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-stencil
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-testing
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-theming
- @ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans

If you were using part of them, please reach out to us so that we can get more information about your usage.

To use the new theme, replace `ods-theme-blue-jeans` with the following:

<Source code="import '@ovhcloud/ods-themes/default';"
        dark="true"
        language="typescript" />

<Heading label="Design tokens" level={ 2 } />

Design tokens are now accessible through the `@ovhcloud/ods-themes` lib.

The list of available tokens has been updated with the latest design changes and match what you may find on the Figma screens.

<Heading label="Components" level={ 2 } />

As each component was refactored, there are too many changes to list everything here.

The main common breaking change is the following: `osds-xxx` component is now `ods-xxx`

A complete list of changes and a guide about how to migrate is available per component in the v18 documentation.

Use the top-left version selector to move to the latest v18.x documentation where you'll find the latest up-to-date information.
