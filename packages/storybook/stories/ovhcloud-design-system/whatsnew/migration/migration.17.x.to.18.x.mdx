# [17.2.2](https://ovh.github.io/design-system/v17.6.0/?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-what-s-new-changelog--page) to [18.0.0](https://ovh.github.io/design-system/v18.0.0/?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-what-s-new-changelog--page) ([compare](https://github.com/ovh/design-system/compare/release/17.0...release/18.0))

From the beginning of the project to the latest v17 version, our vision of the project have greatly evolved.
Thanks to real-user feedbacks, a better understanding of our use cases and how ODS fits in the OVHCloud ecosystem.

With this new version we've tried to tackle most of the known issues to offer a better end-user experience:
- components are now behaving more like native html elements
- components are now easier to use and to customize
- no more invasive `console.log`, we only print meaningful warnings when needed
- enum values can now be used directly instead of importing it
- events are now normalized for all components
- release process will be shorter

On top of that, the v18 does bring new features:
- new components: file-upload and timepicker
- latest design applied on all component
- now sync with figma changes
- a new set of icons
- a reworked documentation

To achieve all this, we had to rewrite almost the whole library.

Thanks to that ODS lib has lost (TODO info about size before and after)

This is a major version change with tons of breaking changes.
But this aims to be the last time.

To help you moving from a previous version to the v18, we've added a dedicated page on each component presenting
the changes and some migration examples.

We'll go here through the major changes of this version.
If you have any questions or issues regarding the new version, feel free to reach us directly.

## ODS libraries

The following libs have been removed:
- @ovhcloud/ods-cdk
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-core
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-stencil
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-testing
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-theming
- @ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans

There is now only two library published that you should include:
- `@ovhcloud/ods-components` that contain all web-components, react and vue wrappers and the sass mixins
- `@ovhcloud/ods-themes` that contain the design tokens and the assets (fonts and icons)

The CDK has been removed and we do not plan on publishing it again. If you were using part of it, please reach
out to us so that we can get more information about your usage.

All common libs have been and we do not plan on publishing them again. If you were using part of them, please reach
out to us so that we can get more information about your usage.

The `blue-jeans` theme has been replace by the default theme of `@ovhcloud/ods-themes`
(see [Themes](TODO url) section for more information).

## ODS dependencies upgrade

The new version comes with the following upgrade on major library:
- Stencil bumps from `4.12.0` to `4.12.2` TODO 4.19?
- `node-sass` is not supported anymore and was replaced by `sass` (`1.71.0`)
- Typescript bumps from `4.7.4` to `5.3.3`
- Storybook bumps from `6.4.19` to `8.0.4`

## Themes

TODO explain how themes works and how to use theme

## Style customization

Although the ODS component comes with the expected design, you can now apply your own style directly on some part
of the web-component shadow DOM, thanks to the [part selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part).

For example, you can add style on the native `input` element of an `ods-input` component through the following code:
```html
<style>
  .my-input::part(input) {
    width: 300px;
  }
</style>

<ods-input class="my-input" ... />
```

Most of the component exposes one or more part like this, you can find more information on each component documentation page.

## Sass helpers

In addition to the easier customization, we're also exposing the "basic" style of some core component as Sass mixins
that you can use to apply on a native element to get the same ODS rendering.

For example, if you need to make a `a` tag looks like an `ods-link`:

```scss
@import '@ovhcloud/ods-components/style';

.my-link {
  @include ods-link();
  @include ods-link-color('primary');
}
```
```html
<a class="my-link" ...>...</a>
```

This can be useful when you can't manage some part of the DOM as you want, for example using a library that will always
render a `a` and that provide no custom templating.

Be careful though, this does only provide basic style, not all the feature of an ODS component, so we do recommend
to use the web-component by default.

## ODS Components

As each component was refactored, there are too many changes to list everything here.

The main common breaking change is the following: `osds-xxx` component is now `ods-xxx`
