<Heading label="Accessibility improvements:" level={ 3 } />

<Heading label="a11y" level={ 4 } />
This version focuses on improving the accessibility for each component.

We've implemented all the internal requirements on each component, validated using <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core">axe-core</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse">lighthouse</ExternalLink>.

Though, ensuring accessibility for your context does require you to use the right `aria`/`role`/... attribute at the right place.

To help you with that, we've added:
- a <StorybookLink title={ HOME_TITLE.accessibilityGuide }>guide about accessibility</StorybookLink> best practices.
- a dedicated `Accessibility` section on each component `Documentation` page.

<Heading label="i18n" level={ 4 } />

Some components provide internal features that need an explicit context.
For example the clear button on the `Input` which require an `aria-label` describing that the button will clear the value.

We do provide default values for each supported locales to ensure that integrating ODS component as is will already convey the minimal information to impaired users.

You can customize those value further with your own translations.

See the related storybook <StorybookLink title={ HOME_TITLE.i18nGuide }>Internationalization guide</StorybookLink> for more information.

Version 19 of ODS is not the direct follow-up of previous versions, it is a new library built 100% on top of <ExternalLink href="https://react.dev">React</ExternalLink>.

<Heading label="Project changes:" level={ 3 } />

Previous versions were providing a React version of each components too, but there were in fact a wrapping of the Web Component.
Thus it was designed with the constraints related to Web Component (no virtual DOM, relying on DOM selector, ...).

With this new version we got rid of those constraints, which gave us some benefits like:
- component composition.
- easier style customization.
- easier React integration (no more `ref` needed, nor literal templates).

Although, we tried to stay as close as possible to previous version behavior, the way you integrate ODS in your React app should be rethought,
to ensure you use components as real React elements and not wrapped Web Components anymore.

To check how to start with this new version, please follow the <StorybookLink title={ HOME_TITLE.getStarted }>Get Started</StorybookLink> documentation.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the major changes:
- rework of all components as React elements.
- tree-shaking.
- less restriction on components customization and usage.
- reduced CSS size by moving to variable fonts.
- no more Ods prefix on all components/constants.
- no more web-components nor Vue wrappers provided.
- updated icons (now with default padding embed).
- updated various component designs (datepicker, message, modal, spinner, ...).
- new design tokens.
- updated documentation.
- card default color changed.
- ...

to our React wrapper test suites, so that we can replicate more easily issues integrators may encounter.

<Heading label="v18.4.0" level={ 2 } />

<Heading label="Changes on form elements:" level={ 3 } />

This version is focused on implementing <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState">ValidityState</ExternalLink> to our form elements.

This allows you to setup a fully working form without the need of any external library or custom validation code, as everything behave as a native form.

Though you can of course use a lib on top of that if you want to. We've validated forms using native code (vanilla and React), <ExternalLink href="https://formik.org">Formik</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://react-hook-form.com">React Hook Form</ExternalLink> on our tests and playgrounds.

The changes on each component are massive, but we did focus on ensuring bumping to this version would be transparent for current ODS users.

We won't go through an exhaustive list of changes, here are the most important ones for each form element:
- Consistent behavior regarding blur and error state.

<Heading label="v18.0.0" level={ 2 } />

As it is a major version, you'll have to follow the <StorybookLink title={ HOME_TITLE.migration17to18 }>migration guide 17.x to 18.x</StorybookLink>

<Heading label="Project changes:" level={ 3 } />

From the beginning of the project to the latest v17 version, our vision of the project has greatly evolved.
Thanks to real-user feedbacks, a better understanding of our use cases and how ODS fits in the OVHCloud ecosystem.

With this new version we've tried to tackle most of the known issues to offer a better end-user experience:
- components are now behaving more like native html elements
- components are now easier to use and to customize
- no more invasive `console.log`, we only print meaningful warnings when needed
- enum values can now be used directly instead of importing it
- events are now normalized for all components
- release process will be shorter

On top of that, the v18 does bring new features:
- new components: file-upload and timepicker
- latest design applied on all components
- now sync with figma changes
- a new set of icons
- a reworked documentation

To achieve all this, we had to rewrite almost the whole library.

This is a major version change with tons of breaking changes.
But this aims to be the last time.

To help you moving from a previous version to the v18, we've added a dedicated page on each component presenting
the changes and some migration examples.

<Heading label="ODS libraries" level={ 3 } />

The following libs have been removed:
- @ovhcloud/ods-cdk
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-core
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-stencil
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-testing
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-theming
- @ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans

There is now only two library published that you should include:
- `@ovhcloud/ods-components` that contain all web-components, react and vue wrappers and the sass mixins
- `@ovhcloud/ods-themes` that contain the design tokens and the assets (fonts and icons)

The CDK has been removed and we do not plan on publishing it again. If you were using part of it, please reach
out to us so that we can get more information about your usage.

All common libs have been and we do not plan on publishing them again. If you were using part of them, please reach
out to us so that we can get more information about your usage.

The `blue-jeans` theme has been replaced by the default theme of `@ovhcloud/ods-themes`.

<Heading label="ODS dependencies upgrade" level={ 3 } />

The new version comes with the following upgrade on major library:
- Stencil bumps from `4.12.0` to `4.16.0`
- `node-sass` is not supported anymore and was replaced by `sass` (`1.71.0`)
- Typescript bumps from `4.7.4` to `5.3.3`
- Storybook bumps from `6.4.19` to `8.0.4`

<Heading label="Style customization" level={ 3 } />

Although the ODS component comes with the expected design, you can now apply your own style directly on some part
of the web-component shadow DOM, thanks to the <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part">part selector</ExternalLink>.

For example, you can add style on the native `input` element of an `ods-input` component through the following code:

<Source code={`
<style>
  .my-input::part(input) {
    width: 300px;
  }
</style>

<ods-input class="my-input" ... />
`}
        dark="true"
        language="html" />

Most of the component exposes one or more part like this, you can find more information on each component documentation page.

<Heading label="Sass helpers" level={ 3 } />

In addition to the easier customization, we're also exposing the "basic" style of some core component as Sass mixins
that you can use to apply on a native element to get the same ODS rendering.

For example, if you need to make an anchor tag looks like an `ods-link`:

<Source code={`
@import '@ovhcloud/ods-components/style';

.my-link {
  @include ods-link();
  @include ods-link-color('primary');
}
`}
        dark="true"
        language="css" />

<Source code={ `<a class="my-link" ...>...</a>` }
        dark="true"
        language="html" />

This can be useful when you can't manage some part of the DOM as you want, for example using a library that will always
render an anchor and that provide no custom templating.

Be careful though, this does only provide basic style, not all the feature of an ODS component, so we do recommend
to use the web-component by default.

As it is a major version, you'll have to follow the <StorybookLink title={ HOME_TITLE.migration16to17 }>migration guide 16.x to 17.x</StorybookLink>

<Heading label="Project changes:" level={ 3 } />

Main focus on this version has been on simplifying ODS integration in existing projects (React, Vue, JS, ...).

We now only publish one `ods-components` library that embed all the ODS components.

What this means for your code:

* `ods-component-xxx` are no longer published and should be removed
* only one dependency to add to your `package.json`

<Source code={ `"ods-components": "17.0.0"` }
        dark="true"
        language="text" />

ODS components can then be either imported using lazy-loading (the code of each component is loaded on demand) or as a module (the code of the component is tree-shaked by your own bundling system).

For more details on how to import ODS components, see:

* the updated <StorybookLink title={ HOME_TITLE.getStarted }>Get Started documentation</StorybookLink>
* the 16.x to 17.x <StorybookLink title={ HOME_TITLE.migration16to17 }>Migration guide</StorybookLink>

<Heading label="Documentation improvements:" level={ 3 } />

We went through each component to update:

* the Demo controls to be more relevant
* the Usage Guidelines, with more examples and the missing properties
* with React example when relevant (ex: `datagrid` reactFormatter with React 18 or `tabs` with React Router)

<Heading label="Component changes:" level={ 3 } />

<Heading label="Bug fixes:" level={ 3 } />

**Button**

* Fix position of end slot when start slot is empty in `OsdsButton`

**Datagrid**

* If the `OsdsDatagrid` contains an overflowing on-interaction element (such as `OsdsMenu`, `OsdsTooltip`, `OsdsSelect` or `OsdsPopover`), the element is either being displayed at the top left corner of the `OsdsDatagrid` (native) or beneath the element, making it unvisible (React). This fix intends to correct this problem in both environments.

* Watch `totalPages` & update it

**Phone Number**

As it is a major version, you'll have to follow the <StorybookLink title={ HOME_TITLE.migration15to16 }>migration guide 15.x to 16.x</StorybookLink>

⚠️We're aware that not all the documentation is up-to-date with the latest technical changes ⚠️

⚠️We're currently working on improving the storybook but didn't want to delay the release much more ⚠️

⚠️If you have any issue migrating, reach us directly and we'll help you. ⚠️

<Heading label="Project changes:" level={ 3 } />

This version embed the whole new project architecture (initiated with the v15).

We now have seperations between:

* `cdk` (@ovhcloud/ods-cdk) which provides public non component related utilities.
* `common` libs (@ovhcloud/ods-common-\[core|stencil|testing|theming]) which provides internal helpers.
* `components` (@ovhcloud/ods-components or @ovhcloud/ods-component-`<component-name>`) which provide the agnostic components and their React, Vue wrapped versions.
* `examples` (@ovhcloud/ods-starter-\[react|react-vite|vue-vite]) which contains application examples that use some ODS components.
* `shared-dependencies` to share common dependencies internally accross projects.
* `storybook` (@ovhcloud/ods-storybook) which tends to centralize all the ODS documentation content.
* `themes` (@ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans) which provides all existing themes that can be applied to ODS.

<Heading label="Component changes:" level={ 3 } />

**All Components**

* `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil` package does not exists anymore.

* Components are now accessible by adding either `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>` or `@ovhcloud/ods-components` dependency.

* All `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-<component>` libs have been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>`.

* All `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-<component>-react` libs have been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>-react`.

* All `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-<component>-vue` libs have been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>- vue`.

* Constants/Enums have been renamed to follow new naming convention:
* All constants are now in UPPER\_SNAKE\_CASE.
* All objects are now in singular form.
* All lists are now in plural form.

Ex:
`OdsSpinnerSize` is now `ODS_SPINNER_SIZE`.
`OdsSpinnerSizeList` is now `ODS_SPINNER_SIZES`.
`OdsSpinnerSizeUnion` has been removed.

* Exported types follow also the same naming convention, thus most of them are now in singular form.

Ex:
`OdsSpinnerAttributes` is now `OdsSpinnerAttribute`.

* A lot of empty types who were exported previously have been removed.

Ex:
`OdsSpinnerEvents` have been removed, as the component does not handle any events.
`OdsSpinnerMethods` have been removed, as the component does not expose any methods.

This version is the first step towards the new ODS internal architecture.
The goal of this refactoring is to simplify and improve the whole project to:

* provide a better developer experience and thus reduce development time

on foreground of the page.

We added a new entire section for `contributions` in the storybook.
Feel free to read the Contributing Documentation if you want to contribute.

We simplified our developer environment with a `global.dev.ts` file in order to
make the developer tests isolated from the production build.

We optimized our CI/CD workflow for a more reactive and efficient build time and release time.

We fixed some issue about automated screenshot testing with some timeout.

We added the select component (version 1).

<StorybookLink kind={ REACT_COMPONENTS_TITLE.select } story={ STORY.documentation }>See Documentation</StorybookLink>

<Heading label="v10.0.0" level={ 2 } />

> If you are an `ODS` contributor, you may need to do some changes

We now build all of our components for `React` and `Vue` frameworks.
They allow to use all the potential and features of your high-end JS framework.
You can read the updated <StorybookLink title={ HOME_TITLE.getStarted }>Getting Started</StorybookLink>
to initialize an App with ODS and see how it works depending the framework.

Also, `ods-cart` is no more impacted by a parent container with `text-align:center`.

`ods-textarea` had an incorrect `spellcheck` property than could be equal to `spellcheck="false'` which is incorrect in HTML.
Now it is in DOM only if it is `true`.

You can now disable animation on `ods-toggle` by defining a CSS value `--ods-toggle-transition-slider: none`.

Css variables `--ods-size-squish-n-*` and `--ods-size-stretch-n-*` are no more incorrect.
It was previously set with only one number instead of two, accordingly with CSS3.

<Heading label="v9.1.0" level={ 2 } />

Adding 2 new components :

* accordion: display a content that can be collapsed
* code: display a snippet of code and copy it into the clipboard

If you already have customized themes, you have to declare the variables for this 2 new components.
see more in the migration guide 9.x
