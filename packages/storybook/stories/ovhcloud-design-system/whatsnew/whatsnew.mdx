As we're working towards a massive uniformisation of all ODS form elements (events, nav behaviour, required state, validity state, ...),
the amount of changes is too important to be released immediatly.

This release brings the expected form-association of form elements, so that they act as native one for
formData submit and reset.

## v17.0.0

As it is a major version, you'll have to follow the [migration guide 16.x to 17.x](?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-what-s-new-migration-guide-16-x-to-17-x--docs)

### Project changes:

Main focus on this version has been on simplifying ODS integration in existing projects (React, Vue, JS, ...).

We now only publish one `ods-components` library that embed all the ODS components.

What this means for your code:

* `ods-component-xxx` are no longer published and should be removed
* only one dependency to add to your `package.json`

```
"ods-components": "17.0.0"
```

ODS components can then be either imported using lazy-loading (the code of each component is loaded on demand) or as a module (the code of the component is tree-shaked by your own bundling system).

For more details on how to import ODS components, see:

* the updated [Get Started documentation](?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-get-started--docs#how-to-use-ods-components-in-my-project)
* the 16.x to 17.x [Migration guide](?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-what-s-new-migration-guide-16-x-to-17-x--docs)

### Documentation improvments

We went through each component to update:

* the Demo controls to be more relevant
* the Usage Guidelines, with more examples and the missing properties
* with React example when relevant (ex: `datagrid` reactFormatter with React 18 or `tabs` with React Router)

### Component changes:

**Pagination**

* Add `odsItemPerPageChanged` when the item per page select change

### Bug fixes:

**Datagrid**

* Overflowing elements can now correctly be displayed (see updated documentation)

**Menu**

* Ellipsis is now correctly displayed on Safari

**Modal**

* Inner element with overlay are now correctly displayed

**Tabs**

* Fix hover rendering

## v16.6.0

### Feature update:

\*\* Breadcrumb \*\*

* Add event on `breadcrumItem` : `odsBreadcrumbItemClick`
* Update `OdsHTMLAnchorElementRel` type

\*\* Chip \*\*

* Added `odsChipRemoval` event
* If `OsdsChip` is removable and is clicked, it will emit event `odsChipRemoval`
* If `OsdsChip` is removable, focused on and key Enter is pressed, it will emit event `odsChipRemoval`

### Bug fixes:

\*\* Button \*\*

* Fix position of end slot when start slot is empty in `OsdsButton`

\*\* Datagrid \*\*

* If the `OsdsDatagrid` contains an overflowing on-interaction element (such as `OsdsMenu`, `OsdsTooltip`, `OsdsSelect` or `OsdsPopover`), the element is either being displayed at the top left corner of the `OsdsDatagrid` (native) or beneath the element, making it unvisible (React). This fix intends to correct this problem in both environments.

\*\* Pagination \*\*

* Add `itemPerPage` in payload event `odsChanged`
* Watch `totalPages` & update it

\*\* PhoneNumber \*\*

* Fix shadow of flag icon in the select that was cut behind overflow

\*\* Components \*\*

* Some components were missing from package.json of components: `medium`, `range`, `toggle`

## v16.0.1

Fixes CI build issues when deploying Storybook.

## v16.0.0

As it is a major version, you'll have to follow the [migration guide 15.x to 16.x](?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-what-s-new-migration-guide-15-x-to-16-x--docs)

⚠️We're aware that not all the documentation is up-to-date with the latest technical changes ⚠️

⚠️We're currently working on improving the storybook but didn't want to delay the release much more ⚠️

⚠️If you have any issue migrating, reach us directly and we'll help you. ⚠️

### Project changes:

This version embed the whole new project architecture (initiated with the v15).

We now have seperations between:

* `cdk` (@ovhcloud/ods-cdk) which provides public non component related utilities.
* `common` libs (@ovhcloud/ods-common-\[core|stencil|testing|theming]) which provides internal helpers.
* `components` (@ovhcloud/ods-components or @ovhcloud/ods-component-`<component-name>`) which provide the agnostic components and their React, Vue wrapped versions.
* `examples` (@ovhcloud/ods-starter-\[react|react-vite|vue-vite]) which contains application examples that use some ODS components.
* `shared-dependencies` to share common dependencies internally accross projects.
* `storybook` (@ovhcloud/ods-storybook) which tends to centralize all the ODS documentation content.
* `themes` (@ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans) which provides all existing themes that can be applied to ODS.

### Component changes:

**All Components**

* `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil` package does not exists anymore.

* Components are now accessible by adding either `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>` or `@ovhcloud/ods-components` dependency.

* All `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-<component>` libs have been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>`.

* All `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-<component>-react` libs have been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>-react`.

* All `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-<component>-vue` libs have been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>- vue`.

* Constants/Enums have been renamed to follow new naming convention:
  * All constants are now in UPPER\_SNAKE\_CASE.
  * All objects are now in singular form.
  * All lists are now in plural form.

Ex:
`OdsSpinnerSize` is now `ODS_SPINNER_SIZE`.
`OdsSpinnerSizeList` is now `ODS_SPINNER_SIZES`.
`OdsSpinnerSizeUnion` has been removed.

* Exported types follow also the same naming convention, thus most of them are now in singular form.

Ex:
`OdsSpinnerAttributes` is now `OdsSpinnerAttribute`.

* A lot of empty types who were exported previously have been removed.

Ex:
`OdsSpinnerEvents` have been removed, as the component does not handle any events.
`OdsSpinnerMethods` have been removed, as the component does not expose any methods.

### New component:

* **Clipboard**: [See Documentation](?path=/story/ui-components-clipboard-atom-web-component--default)
* **Menu**: [See Documentation](?path=/story/menu--default)
* **Modal**: [See Documentation](?path=/story/modal--default)
* **Search Bar**: [See Documentation](?path=/story/ui-components-search-bar-atom-web-component--default)

### Features changes:

### Bug fixes:

**Button**

**Flag**

* Flags are now correctly displayed in the documentation.

**Link**

## v15.0.1

This version is the first step towards the new ODS internal architecture.
The goal of this refactoring is to simplify and improve the whole project to:

New attributes are available on this component: `lazy`, `assetPath` and `src`.

Before importing any component you now have to setup ods, for more details see [migration guide 10.x to 11.x](?path=/story/code-migration-guide-10-x-to-11-x--docs).

[Dual range](?path=/story/range--dual) is now available for Range component; It offers two handles to set a min and max value.

To build resilient infrastructure and promote sustainable industrialization, we moved code that could be agnostic.
Now, ODS components logic has been moved into controllers.

We now build all of our components for `React` and `Vue` frameworks.
They allow to use all the potential and features of your high-end JS framework.
You can read the updated [Getting Started](?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-get-started--docs)
and more especially the [ODS Starters chapter](?path=/story/ovhcloud-design-system-get-started--docs#ods-starters)
to initialize an App with ODS and see how it works depending the framework.

Also, `ods-cart` is no more impacted by a parent container with `text-align:center`.

`ods-textarea` had an incorrect `spellcheck` property than could be equal to `spellcheck="false'` which is incorrect in HTML.
Now it is in DOM only if it is `true`.

You can now disable animation on `ods-toggle` by defining a CSS value `--ods-toggle-transition-slider: none`.

Css variables `--ods-size-squish-n-*` and `--ods-size-stretch-n-*` are no more incorrect.
It was previously set with only one number instead of two, accordingly with CSS3.

As it is a major version, you have to do the [migration guide 9.x to 10.x](?path=/story/code-migration-guide-9-x-to-10-x--docs)
