<Heading label="v18.0.0" level={ 2 } />

As it is a major version, you'll have to follow the <StorybookLink label="migration guide 17.x to 18.x" title="OVHcloud Design System/What's new?/Migration guide/17.x to 18.x" />

<Heading label="Project changes:" level={ 3 } />

From the beginning of the project to the latest v17 version, our vision of the project has greatly evolved.
Thanks to real-user feedbacks, a better understanding of our use cases and how ODS fits in the OVHCloud ecosystem.

With this new version we've tried to tackle most of the known issues to offer a better end-user experience:
- components are now behaving more like native html elements
- components are now easier to use and to customize
- no more invasive `console.log`, we only print meaningful warnings when needed
- enum values can now be used directly instead of importing it
- events are now normalized for all components
- release process will be shorter

On top of that, the v18 does bring new features:
- new components: file-upload and timepicker
- latest design applied on all components
- now sync with figma changes
- a new set of icons
- a reworked documentation

To achieve all this, we had to rewrite almost the whole library.

This is a major version change with tons of breaking changes.
But this aims to be the last time.

To help you moving from a previous version to the v18, we've added a dedicated page on each component presenting
the changes and some migration examples.

<Heading label="ODS libraries" level={ 3 } />

The following libs have been removed:
- @ovhcloud/ods-cdk
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-core
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-stencil
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-testing
- @ovhcloud/ods-common-theming
- @ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans

There is now only two library published that you should include:
- `@ovhcloud/ods-components` that contain all web-components, react and vue wrappers and the sass mixins
- `@ovhcloud/ods-themes` that contain the design tokens and the assets (fonts and icons)

The CDK has been removed and we do not plan on publishing it again. If you were using part of it, please reach
out to us so that we can get more information about your usage.

All common libs have been and we do not plan on publishing them again. If you were using part of them, please reach
out to us so that we can get more information about your usage.

The `blue-jeans` theme has been replaced by the default theme of `@ovhcloud/ods-themes`.

<Heading label="ODS dependencies upgrade" level={ 3 } />

The new version comes with the following upgrade on major library:
- Stencil bumps from `4.12.0` to `4.16.0`
- `node-sass` is not supported anymore and was replaced by `sass` (`1.71.0`)
- Typescript bumps from `4.7.4` to `5.3.3`
- Storybook bumps from `6.4.19` to `8.0.4`

<Heading label="Style customization" level={ 3 } />

Although the ODS component comes with the expected design, you can now apply your own style directly on some part
of the web-component shadow DOM, thanks to the <OdsLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part" label="part selector" target="_blank" />.

For example, you can add style on the native `input` element of an `ods-input` component through the following code:

<Source code={`
<style>
  .my-input::part(input) {
    width: 300px;
  }
</style>

<ods-input class="my-input" ... />
`}
        dark="true"
        language="html" />

Most of the component exposes one or more part like this, you can find more information on each component documentation page.

<Heading label="Sass helpers" level={ 3 } />

In addition to the easier customization, we're also exposing the "basic" style of some core component as Sass mixins
that you can use to apply on a native element to get the same ODS rendering.

For example, if you need to make an anchor tag looks like an `ods-link`:

<Source code={`
@import '@ovhcloud/ods-components/style';

.my-link {
  @include ods-link();
  @include ods-link-color('primary');
}
`}
        dark="true"
        language="css" />

<Source code={ `<a class="my-link" ...>...</a>` }
        dark="true"
        language="html" />

This can be useful when you can't manage some part of the DOM as you want, for example using a library that will always
render an anchor and that provide no custom templating.

Be careful though, this does only provide basic style, not all the feature of an ODS component, so we do recommend
to use the web-component by default.

As we're working towards a massive uniformization of all ODS form elements (events, nav behaviour, required state, validity state, ...),
the amount of changes is too important to be released immediately.

This release brings the expected form-association of form elements, so that they act as native one for
formData submit and reset.

It also fixes the missing types of event (`odsBlur`, `odsFocus`, `odsValueChange`).

As it is a major version, you'll have to follow the <StorybookLink label="migration guide 16.x to 17.x" title="OVHcloud Design System/What's new?/Migration guide/16.x to 17.x" />

<Heading label="Project changes:" level={ 3 } />

Main focus on this version has been on simplifying ODS integration in existing projects (React, Vue, JS, ...).

We now only publish one `ods-components` library that embed all the ODS components.

What this means for your code:

* `ods-component-xxx` are no longer published and should be removed
* only one dependency to add to your `package.json`

<Source code={ `"ods-components": "17.0.0"` }
        dark="true"
        language="text" />

ODS components can then be either imported using lazy-loading (the code of each component is loaded on demand) or as a module (the code of the component is tree-shaked by your own bundling system).

For more details on how to import ODS components, see:

* the updated <StorybookLink label="Get Started documentation" title="OVHcloud Design System/Get Started" />
* the 16.x to 17.x <StorybookLink label="Migration guide" title="OVHcloud Design System/What's new?/Migration guide/16.x to 17.x" />

<Heading label="Documentation improvements:" level={ 3 } />

We went through each component to update:

* the Demo controls to be more relevant
* the Usage Guidelines, with more examples and the missing properties
* with React example when relevant (ex: `datagrid` reactFormatter with React 18 or `tabs` with React Router)

**Button**

* Fix position of end slot when start slot is empty in `OsdsButton`

**Datagrid**

* If the `OsdsDatagrid` contains an overflowing on-interaction element (such as `OsdsMenu`, `OsdsTooltip`, `OsdsSelect` or `OsdsPopover`), the element is either being displayed at the top left corner of the `OsdsDatagrid` (native) or beneath the element, making it unvisible (React). This fix intends to correct this problem in both environments.

**Pagination**

* Add `itemPerPage` in payload event `odsChange`
* Watch `totalPages` & update it

**PhoneNumber**

As it is a major version, you'll have to follow the <StorybookLink label="migration guide 15.x to 16.x" title="OVHcloud Design System/What's new?/Migration guide/15.x to 16.x" />

⚠️We're aware that not all the documentation is up-to-date with the latest technical changes ⚠️

⚠️We're currently working on improving the storybook but didn't want to delay the release much more ⚠️

⚠️If you have any issue migrating, reach us directly and we'll help you. ⚠️

<Heading label="Project changes:" level={ 3 } />

This version embed the whole new project architecture (initiated with the v15).

We now have seperations between:

* `cdk` (@ovhcloud/ods-cdk) which provides public non component related utilities.
* `common` libs (@ovhcloud/ods-common-\[core|stencil|testing|theming]) which provides internal helpers.
* `components` (@ovhcloud/ods-components or @ovhcloud/ods-component-`<component-name>`) which provide the agnostic components and their React, Vue wrapped versions.
* `examples` (@ovhcloud/ods-starter-\[react|react-vite|vue-vite]) which contains application examples that use some ODS components.
* `shared-dependencies` to share common dependencies internally accross projects.
* `storybook` (@ovhcloud/ods-storybook) which tends to centralize all the ODS documentation content.
* `themes` (@ovhcloud/ods-theme-blue-jeans) which provides all existing themes that can be applied to ODS.

<Heading label="Component changes:" level={ 3 } />

**All Components**

* `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil` package does not exists anymore.

* Components are now accessible by adding either `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>` or `@ovhcloud/ods-components` dependency.

* All `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-<component>` libs have been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>`.

* All `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-<component>-react` libs have been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>-react`.

* All `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-<component>-vue` libs have been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-<component>- vue`.

* Constants/Enums have been renamed to follow new naming convention:
* All constants are now in UPPER\_SNAKE\_CASE.
* All objects are now in singular form.
* All lists are now in plural form.

Ex:
`OdsSpinnerSize` is now `ODS_SPINNER_SIZE`.
`OdsSpinnerSizeList` is now `ODS_SPINNER_SIZES`.
`OdsSpinnerSizeUnion` has been removed.

* Exported types follow also the same naming convention, thus most of them are now in singular form.

Ex:
`OdsSpinnerAttributes` is now `OdsSpinnerAttribute`.

* A lot of empty types who were exported previously have been removed.

Ex:
`OdsSpinnerEvents` have been removed, as the component does not handle any events.
`OdsSpinnerMethods` have been removed, as the component does not expose any methods.

As it is a major version, you have to do the <StorybookLink label="migration guide 14.x to 15.x" title="OVHcloud Design System/What's new?/Migration guide/14.x to 15.x" />

<Heading label="Project changes:" level={ 3 } />

This version is the first step towards the new ODS internal architecture.
The goal of this refactoring is to simplify and improve the whole project to:

* provide a better developer experience and thus reduce development time
* normalize all components behavior / design / attributes
* have better control on dependencies and lib version upgrade
* have better control on what ODS expose (through component or CDK)
* ...

This first step only impact two components `osds-text` and `osds-textarea`.

All other components will follow on next version.

Then common ODS lib and theming will be refactored on next version.

<Heading label="Features changes:" level={ 3 } />

* **Text**

* `OsdsText` is no longer part of `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil` package.

* `OsdsText` is now accessible by adding either `@ovhcloud/ods-component-text` or `@ovhcloud/ods-components` dependency.

* `@ovhcloud/ods-stencil-text` lib has been replaced by `@ovhcloud/ods-component-text`.

Flag component has been modified; you’ll need to update as explained in the migration guide.
For more details about assets, see <StorybookLink label="Installation" title="OVHcloud Design System/Get Started" /> page.
New attributes are available on this component: `lazy`, `assetPath` and `src`.

Before importing any component you now have to setup ods, for more details see <StorybookLink label="migration guide 10.x to 11.x" title="OVHcloud Design System/What's new?/Migration guide/10.x to 11.x" />

Dual range is now available for Range component; It offers two handles to set a min and max value.

To build resilient infrastructure and promote sustainable industrialization, we moved code that could be agnostic.
Now, ODS components logic has been moved into controllers.
If you want to contribute to ODS by developing new components, please refer to the how-to section for controllers in our Storybook.

Now, Button component has `download` and `rel` new attributes available when it is used as a link (href).

We had blur events on Quantity component to set the correct value regarding the Quantity bounds.
It means when the user set manually a value that is out of bounds for Quantity, the value will be automatically reset to a correct value.

on foreground of the page.

We added a new entire section for `contributions` in the storybook.
Feel free to read the Contributing Documentation if you want to contribute.

We simplified our developer environment with a `global.dev.ts` file in order to
make the developer tests isolated from the production build.

We now build all of our components for `React` and `Vue` frameworks.
They allow to use all the potential and features of your high-end JS framework.
You can read the updated <StorybookLink label="Getting Started" title="OVHcloud Design System/Get Started" />
to initialize an App with ODS and see how it works depending the framework.

Also, `ods-cart` is no more impacted by a parent container with `text-align:center`.

`ods-textarea` had an incorrect `spellcheck` property than could be equal to `spellcheck="false'` which is incorrect in HTML.
Now it is in DOM only if it is `true`.

You can now disable animation on `ods-toggle` by defining a CSS value `--ods-toggle-transition-slider: none`.

Css variables `--ods-size-squish-n-*` and `--ods-size-stretch-n-*` are no more incorrect.
It was previously set with only one number instead of two, accordingly with CSS3.
