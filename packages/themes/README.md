## How to update ods-icon font?

The ods-icon font is managed through icomoon.

1. Update the font files and the selection:

- go to the icomoon app: https://icomoon.io/app/#/projects
- click on `Import Project` and select the `selection.json` file located in `assets/fonts/ods-icon/icomoon`
- add/remove/update the icons you want
- click on `Generate Font` on the bottom, double check that all icons and names are correct, then click on `Download`
- unzip the downloaded file and copy all files from its `fonts` subdirectory plus the `selection.json` into `assets/fonts/ods-icon/icomoon`

2. Transform into base64:

As we can't provide the font from an external source for now, we have to embed it in the css.
We'll use only the `.woff` file.

To get the base64 value, run the following HTML/JS code in some editor (local or like codepen):
```html
<input type="file" onchange="base64convert(this.files)">
```

```js
function base64convert(files) {
  const reader = new FileReader()
  reader.onload = (e) => {
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(e.target.result || '');
  }
  reader.readAsDataURL(files[0])
}
```
Select the `.woff` file and the base64 value will be automatically available into your clipboard.

Edit the `assets/fonts/ods-icon/index.scss` file with the value from your clipboard:
```scss
$icomoon-base64: url(<copy_your_value_here>);
```

3. Build the project

Run `npm run build:prod` at the root of the project.

The new font is now available for other projects to use.

4. Update `ods-icon`

Depending on your changes, you may need to go update the `ods-icon` component constants with the updated values.

You'll find the value of each icon content in the `style.css` file in the icomoon extracted directory previously downloaded.

/!\ Some component are using icon content directly, you need to double check if your changes did not broke anything for those.
(you can found them using a search on `@include icon.ods-icon();` in the `ods/src/components` directory)

/!\ Please check also the icon tags list on the storybook icon story (`storybook/stories/components/icon/icon.stories.ts`).
